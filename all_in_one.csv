(2) do women and men differ in the time to appointment of program director?methodsa list of 207 orthopaedic surgery residencies was obtained from the accreditation council for graduate medical education (acgme) website for the academic year 2021 to 2022. the study excluded 6% (13) of programs; 4% (8) were those without acgme accreditation and those with initial accreditation, and 2% (5) did not have updated 2021 to 2022 resident lists. descriptive information on 194 programs was obtained from publicly accessible resources from july 2021 through july 2022. the institution's website and the american medical association's (ama) fellowship and residency electronic interactive database (freida) was used to collect residency program characteristics and resident demographics [2]. doximity, healthgrades, and linkedin were used to further collect current orthopaedic surgery residency program director demographics, including gender, age, and education/training history. to determine gender, photographs and pronouns (she/her/hers or he/him/hers) used in their biographies were used first. to confirm this, secondary sources were used including their npi profile, which lists gender; doximity; and their linkedin profile. scopus was used to analyze research output by the program directors - using the hirsch index (h-index) as the primary bibliometric metric. a total of 194 program directors were identified, of whom of 12% (23) were women and 88% (171) were men. of the 4421 total residents among these programs, 20% (887) were women and 80% (3534) were men. a univariate analysis comparing program directors was conducted, with continuous variables analyzed using an independent-sample t-test and categorical variables analyzed using a pearson chi-square test. with the numbers available, a post hoc statistical power calculation indicated that we could detect an 32% difference in the percentage of women in a program as significant with 80% power at the p < 0.05 level, whereas we might have been underpowered to discern smaller differences than that.resultswith the numbers available, we found no difference in the percentage of women in residency programs run by women program directors than in programs in which the program director was a man (22% [125 of 558] versus 20% [762 of 3863], mean difference 2% [95% ci -1.24% to 7.58%]; p = 0.08). comparing women to men program directors, women had fewer years between residency completion and appointment to the position of program director (8 +- 2 years versus 12 +- 7 years, mean difference 4 years [95% ci 2.01 to 7.93 years]; p = 0.02) and had a lower mean h-index (7 +- 4 versus 11 +- 11, mean difference 4 [95% ci 1.70 to 6.56]; p = 0.03) and number of publications (24 +- 23 versus 41 +- 62, mean difference 17 [95% ci 3.98 to 31.05]; p = 0.01), although they did not differ in terms of their advanced degrees, duration of training, or likelihood of having taken a fellowship.conclusionorthopaedic residency programs that were run by women did not contain a higher percentage of women residents, suggesting that the gender of the individual in that role may not be as important as has been speculated by others. future studies should investigate the intersectionality of gender, race, and ethnicity of residents, program directors, and current faculty.clinical relevancethe fact that women were placed in program director roles earlier in career may also carry special jeopardy for them. those roles are difficult and can impair a faculty member's ability to conduct individual research, which often is key to further academic promotions. given that and the fact that the gender of the program director was not associated with differences in gender composition of residency programs, we believe that increasing mentorship and access to pipeline programs will help promote diversity in residency programs.

(2) keyword cluster analysis demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness analysis of bare metal stents and drug-eluting stents in coronary disease, the cost-effectiveness analysis of angioplasty stent intervention, and the effect of coronary stents in percutaneous coronary intervention are the research hot spots in the field of health economics evaluation of vascular stent research. (3) in the context of medical quality management, the paper further summarized the research hot spots on the therapeutic effect of vascular stents as follows: long-term effect of vascular stents, safety, drug release mechanism research, personalized therapy, restenosis problems, and stent insertion technology. (4) the results of highly cited literature analysis exhibited that drug-eluting stents release drugs to reduce the risk of vascular restenosis, and the restenosis rate is lower than that of bare metal stents, but the cost is usually higher. biodegradable stents combine the advantages of bare metal stents and drug-eluting stents, that is, avoiding long-term stent existence and reducing the risk of restenosis, but their cost may be higher, and there may be some complications in the short term, and they are not widely used at present. (5) in addition to the direct stent cost, factors that need to be considered when comparing the cost-effectiveness of vascular stents include the risk and cost of stent re-intervention, the risk and cost of complications, the duration and cost of drug therapy, and the quality of life of patients. therefore, while the initial cost of drug-eluting and biodegradable stents may be higher than bare metal stents, they may lead to better clinical outcomes in the long term, resulting in a more favorable cost effect.
