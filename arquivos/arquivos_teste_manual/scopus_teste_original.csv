The major brunt of the disease has been on African, South-East Asian and South American countries. Proportionally, malaria has attracted global research priorities and this is evident from the number of publications related to malaria from across the globe, irrespective of its endemicity. However, formal and exhaustive analyses of these ‘malaria publications’ are rarely reported. The systematic review and secondary data analyses were done to retrieve information on what has been published on malaria, where is it published, and which countries are major contributors to malaria research. The study presents malaria publications from 1945 to 2020 retrieved using three databases: Web of Science™, Embase® and Scopus®. Exported data were examined to determine the number of publications over time, their subject areas, contributions from various countries/organizations, and top publishing journals. The total number of published records on malaria ranged from 90,282 to 112,698 (due to three different databases). Based on the number of publications, USA, UK, France, and India were identified as the top four countries. Malaria Journal, American Journal of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene, and PLoS One were the most preferred journals, whereas the University of London (Institutions other than LSHTM), the National Institute of Health, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the University of Oxford appeared to be the top contributing organization. A disproportional contribution to malaria research was observed with non-malaria endemic countries making the largest contribution. Databases differed in their output format and needed standardization to make the outputs comparable across databases. © The Author(s) 2024.","Countries; Journals; Malaria; Publications; Subject","Bibliometrics;

Findings reveal a growing literature output, with the past five years contributing to 36.2 % of publications. Norway leads in total publications and collaboration intensity, with the University of Salzburg and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology as prominent institutions. The research spans a wide range of disciplines such as Sport Sciences, Physiology, etc., and interdisciplinary intersections with engineering, computer science, etc. have become a future research trend. The research focuses on the analysis of skiers' sports performance, the analysis of skiing-induced sports injuries, the biomechanical analysis of skiers' postures, and the analysis of skiing-induced respiratory diseases. The study highlights the evolution of research focus from skiing injuries to injury prevention and sports performance enhancement. This comprehensive overview aids scholars in understanding skiing research hotspots and future trends efficiently. © 2024","Bibliometrics; CiteSpace; Development trend; Skiing; VOSviewer","","","","","","Vernillo G., Pisoni C., Thiebat G., Physiological and physical profile of Snowboarding: a preliminary review, Front.

The major brunt of the disease has been on African, South-East Asian and South American countries. Proportionally, malaria has attracted global research priorities and this is evident from the number of publications related to malaria from across the globe, irrespective of its endemicity. However, formal and exhaustive analyses of these ‘malaria publications’ are rarely reported. The systematic review and secondary data analyses were done to retrieve information on what has been published on malaria, where is it published, and which countries are major contributors to malaria research. The study presents malaria publications from 1945 to 2020 retrieved using three databases: Web of Science™, Embase® and Scopus®. Exported data were examined to determine the number of publications over time, their subject areas, contributions from various countries/organizations, and top publishing journals. The total number of published records on malaria ranged from 90,282 to 112,698 (due to three different databases). Based on the number of publications, USA, UK, France, and India were identified as the top four countries. Malaria Journal, American Journal of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene, and PLoS One were the most preferred journals, whereas the University of London (Institutions other than LSHTM), the National Institute of Health, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the University of Oxford appeared to be the top contributing organization. A disproportional contribution to malaria research was observed with non-malaria endemic countries making the largest contribution. Databases differed in their output format and needed standardization to make the outputs comparable across databases. © The Author(s) 2024.","Countries; Journals; Malaria; Publications; Subject","Bibliometrics;
