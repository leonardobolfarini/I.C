aria m.; cuccurullo c.	<i>bibliometrix</i>: an r-tool for comprehensive science mapping analysis	2017	journal of informetrics	10.1016/j.joi.2017.08.007	the use of bibliometrics is gradually extending to all disciplines. it is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. as it is programmed in r, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical r-packages. it is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.

rodriguez a.; laio a.	clustering by fast search and find of density peaks	2014	science	10.1126/science.1242072	a cluster analysis is aimed at classifying elements into categories on the basis of their similarity. its applications range from astronomy to bioinformatics, bibliometrics, and pattern recognition. we propose an approach based on the idea that cluster centers are characterized by a higher density than their neighbors and by a relatively large distance from points with higher densities. this idea forms the basis of a clustering procedure in which the number of clusters arises intuitively, outliers are automatically spotted and excluded fromthe analysis, and clusters are recognized regardless of their shape and of the dimensionality of the space inwhich they are embedded. we demonstrate the power of the algorithm on several test cases.	
zupic i.; cater t.	bibliometric methods in management and organization	2015	organizational research methods	10.1177/1094428114562629	we aim to develop a meaningful single-source reference for management and organization scholars interested in using bibliometric methods for mapping research specialties. such methods introduce a measure of objectivity into the evaluation of scientific literature and hold the potential to increase rigor and mitigate researcher bias in reviews of scientific literature by aggregating the opinions of multiple scholars working in the field. we introduce the bibliometric methods of citation analysis, co-citation analysis, bibliographical coupling, co-author analysis, and co-word analysis and present a workflow for conducting bibliometric studies with guidelines for researchers. we envision that bibliometric methods will complement meta-analysis and qualitative structured literature reviews as a method for reviewing and evaluating scientific literature. to demonstrate bibliometric methods, we performed a citation and co-citation analysis to map the intellectual structure of the organizational research methods journal.	bibliometrics; co-citation; bibliographic coupling; science mapping
mongeon p.; paul-hus a.	the journal coverage of web of science and scopus: a comparative analysis	2016	scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-015-1765-5	bibliometric methods are used in multiple fields for a variety of purposes, namely for research evaluation. most bibliometric analyses have in common their data sources: thomson reuters' web of science (wos) and elsevier's scopus. the objective of this research is to describe the journal coverage of those two databases and to assess whether some field, publishing country and language are over or underrepresented. to do this we compared the coverage of active scholarly journals in wos (13,605 journals) and scopus (20,346 journals) with ulrich's extensive periodical directory (63,013 journals). results indicate that the use of either wos or scopus for research evaluation may introduce biases that favor natural sciences and engineering as well as biomedical research to the detriment of social sciences and arts and humanities. similarly, english-language journals are overrepresented to the detriment of other languages. while both databases share these biases, their coverage differs substantially. as a consequence, the results of bibliometric analyses may vary depending on the database used. these results imply that in the context of comparative research evaluation, wos and scopus should be used with caution, especially when comparing different fields, institutions, countries or languages. the bibliometric community should continue its efforts to develop methods and indicators that include scientific output that are not covered in wos or scopus, such as field-specific and national citation indexes.	bibliometrics; citation indexes; scopus; web of science; research evaluation

ellegaard o.; wallin j.a.	the bibliometric analysis of scholarly production: how great is the impact?	2015	scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-015-1645-z	bibliometric methods or analysis are now firmly established as scientific specialties and are an integral part of research evaluation methodology especially within the scientific and applied fields. the methods are used increasingly when studying various aspects of science and also in the way institutions and universities are ranked worldwide. a sufficient number of studies have been completed, and with the resulting literature, it is now possible to analyse the bibliometric method by using its own methodology. the bibliometric literature in this study, which was extracted from web of science, is divided into two parts using a method comparable to the method of jonkers et al. (characteristics of bibliometrics articles in library and information sciences (lis) and other journals, pp. 449-551, 2012: the publications either lie within the information and library science (ils) category or within the non-ils category which includes more applied, subject based studies. the impact in the different groupings is judged by means of citation analysis using normalized data and an almost linear increase can be observed from 1994 onwards in the non-ils category. the implication for the dissemination and use of the bibliometric methods in the different contexts is discussed. a keyword analysis identifies the most popular subjects covered by bibliometric analysis, and multidisciplinary articles are shown to have the highest impact. a noticeable shift is observed in those countries which contribute to the pool of bibliometric analysis, as well as a self-perpetuating effect in giving and taking references.	bibliometric analysis; citation analysis; publication analysis; impact of publications
fahimnia b.; sarkis j.; davarzani h.	green supply chain management: a review and bibliometric analysis	2015	international journal of production economics	10.1016/j.ijpe.2015.01.003	the emergent field of green supply chain management has been rapidly evolving with a geometric growth in the number of academic publications in this field. a number of literature reviews have been published focusing on specific aspects of green supply chain management such as performance measurement, supplier selection/evaluation, analytical modeling efforts, and some others with broader areas of focus. this paper presents a thorough bibliometric and network analysis that provides insights not previously fully grasped or evaluated by other reviews on this topic. the analysis begins by identifying over 1000 published studies, which are then distilled down to works of proven influence and those authored by influential investigators. using rigorous bibliometric tools, established and emergent research clusters are identified for topological analysis, identification of key research topics, interrelations, and collaboration patterns. this systematic mapping of the field helps graphically illustrate the publications evolution over time and identify areas of current research interests and potential directions for future research. the findings provide a robust roadmap for further investigation in this field.

bornmann l.; daniel h.d.	what do citation counts measure? a review of studies on citing behavior	2008	journal of documentation	10.1108/00220410810844150	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to present a narrative review of studies on the citing behavior of scientists, covering mainly research published in the last 15 years. based oil the results of these studies, the paper seeks to answer the question of the extent to which scientists are motivated to cite a publication not only to acknowledge intellectual mid cognitive influences of scientific peers, but also for other, possibly non-scientific, reasons. design/methodology/approach - the review covers research published from the early 1960; up to mid-2005 (approximately 30 studies on citing behavior-reporting results in about 40 publications). findings - the general tendency of the results of the empirical studies makes it clear that citing behavior is not motivated solely by the wish to acknowledge intellectual and cognitive influences of colleague scientists, since the individual studies reveal also other, in part non-scientific, factors that play a part in the decision to cite. however, the results of the studies must also be deemed scarcely reliable: the studies vary widely in design, and their results can hardly be replicated. many of the studies have methodological weaknesses. furthermore, there is evidence that file different motivations of citers are not so different or 'randomly given' to such an extent that the phenomenon of citation would lose its role as a reliable measure of impact. originality/value - given the increasing importance of evaluative bibliometrics ill the world of scholarship, the question what do citation counts measure? is a particularly relevant and topical issue.	reference services; bibliographic systems
eysenbach g.	can tweets predict citations? metrics of social impact based on twitter and correlation with traditional metrics of scientific impact	2011	journal of medical internet research	10.2196/jmir.2012	background: citations in peer-reviewed articles and the impact factor are generally accepted measures of scientific impact. web 2.0 tools such as twitter, blogs or social bookmarking tools provide the possibility to construct innovative article-level or journal-level metrics to gauge impact and influence. however, the relationship of the these new metrics to traditional metrics such as citations is not known. objective: (1) to explore the feasibility of measuring social impact of and public attention to scholarly articles by analyzing buzz in social media, (2) to explore the dynamics, content, and timing of tweets relative to the publication of a scholarly article, and (3) to explore whether these metrics are sensitive and specific enough to predict highly cited articles. methods: between july 2008 and november 2011, all tweets containing links to articles in the journal of medical internet research (jmir) were mined. for a subset of 1573 tweets about 55 articles published between issues 3/2009 and 2/2010, different metrics of social media impact were calculated and compared against subsequent citation data from scopus and google scholar 17 to 29 months later. a heuristic to predict the top-cited articles in each issue through tweet metrics was validated. results: a total of 4208 tweets cited 286 distinct jmir articles. the distribution of tweets over the first 30 days after article publication followed a power law (zipf, bradford, or pareto distribution), with most tweets sent on the day when an article was published (1458/3318, 43.94% of all tweets in a 60-day period) or on the following day (528/3318, 15.9%), followed by a rapid decay. the pearson correlations between tweetations and citations were moderate and statistically significant, with correlation coefficients ranging from .42 to .72 for the log-transformed google scholar citations, but were less clear for scopus citations and rank correlations. a linear multivariate model with time and tweets as significant predictors (p < .001) could explain 27% of the variation of citations. highly tweeted articles were 11 times more likely to be highly cited than less-tweeted articles (9/12 or 75% of highly tweeted article were highly cited, while only 3/43 or 7% of less-tweeted articles were highly cited; rate ratio 0.75/0.07 = 10.75, 95% confidence interval, 3.4-33.6). top-cited articles can be predicted from top-tweeted articles with 93% specificity and 75% sensitivity. conclusions: tweets can predict highly cited articles within the first 3 days of article publication. social media activity either increases citations or reflects the underlying qualities of the article that also predict citations, but the true use of these metrics is to measure the distinct concept of social impact. social impact measures based on tweets are proposed to complement traditional citation metrics. the proposed twimpact factor may be a useful and timely metric to measure uptake of research findings and to filter research findings resonating with the public in real time.	bibliometrics; blogging; periodicals as topic; peer-review; publishing; social media analytics; scientometrics; infodemiology; infometrics; reproducibility of results; medicine 2.0; power law; twitter

durieux v.; gevenois p.a.	bibliometric indicators: quality measurements of scientific publication	2010	radiology	10.1148/radiol.09090626	bibliometrics is a set of mathematical and statistical methods used to analyze and measure the quantity and quality of books, articles, and other forms of publications. there are three types of bibliometric indicators: quantity indicators, which measure the productivity of a particular researcher; quality indicators, which measure the quality (or performance) of a researcher's output; and structural indicators, which measure connections between publications, authors, and areas of research. bibliometric indicators are especially important for researchers and organizations, as these measurements are often used in funding decisions, appointments, and promotions of researchers. as more and more scientific discoveries occur and published research results are read and then quoted by other researchers, bibliometric indicators are becoming increasingly important. this article provides an overview of the currently used bibliometric indicators and summarizes the critical elements and characteristics one should be aware of when evaluating the quantity and quality of scientific output.

van der have r.p.; rubalcaba l.	social innovation research: an emerging area of innovation studies?	2016	research policy	10.1016/j.respol.2016.06.010	while the adoption of social innovation (si) in the governance and policy domain has fueled a rapidly expanding scholarly literature, this field has become characterized by conceptual ambiguity and a diversity of definitions and research settings. this present situation inhibits the integration of findings. this paper traces the content, scope and relatively short history of modern social innovation research across disciplines by applying network and bibliometric analyses, and explores their relevance to innovation studies. based on data from 172 publications, we analyze scholarly works that directly address the social innovation topic, allowing us to identify the precedence, dynamics and the current map of social innovation research as an emerging field of study. our analysis suggests that the si field is grounded in four distinct intellectual communities arising through a somewhat organized diffusion process: 1) community psychology; 2) creativity research; 3) social and societal challenges; 4) local development. the interest of si in the areas of management and entrepreneurship is only very recent and is currently reflected within existing communities. we forge conceptual bridges between the two (currently very separate) domains of social innovation and innovation studies, and the implications of our finding for further research and policy are also discussed.

waltman l.; van eck n.j.	a new methodology for constructing a publication-level classification system of science	2012	journal of the american society for information science and technology	10.1002/asi.22748	classifying journals or publications into research areas is an essential element of many bibliometric analyses. classification usually takes place at the level of journals, where the web of science subject categories are the most popular classification system. however, journal-level classification systems have two important limitations: they offer only a limited amount of detail, and they have difficulties with multidisciplinary journals. to avoid these limitations, we introduce a new methodology for constructing classification systems at the level of individual publications. in the proposed methodology, publications are clustered into research areas based on citation relations. the methodology is able to deal with very large numbers of publications. we present an application in which a classification system is produced that includes almost 10 million publications. based on an extensive analysis of this classification system, we discuss the strengths and the limitations of the proposed methodology. important strengths are the transparency and relative simplicity of the methodology and its fairly modest computing and memory requirements. the main limitation of the methodology is its exclusive reliance on direct citation relations between publications. the accuracy of the methodology can probably be increased by also taking into account other types of relationsfor instance, based on bibliographic coupling.	citation analysis; bibliometrics

weingart p.	impact of bibliometrics upon the science system: inadvertent consequences?	2005	scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-005-0007-7	the introduction of bibliometric (and other) ranking is an answer to legitimation pressures on the higher education and research system. after years of hesitation by scientists, science administrators and even politicians in many of the industrialized countries, the implementation of bibliometrics based (and other types of) rankings for institutions of higher education and research is now being introduced on a full scale. what used to be an irritation to the parties concerned has suddenly become a fad. in contrast to this rather sudden enthusiasm, there is very little reflection on the impacts of this practice on the system itself. so far empirical data on the impact of bibliometric rankings seem to be available only for two cases: australia and the british research assessment exercise (ra-e). thus, the actual steering effects of bibliometric rankings, the reactions of the system are largely unknown. rankings are in urgent demand by politics. the intended effect is to create competition among institutions of higher learning and research and thereby to increase their efficiency. the rankings are supposed to identify excellence in these institutions and among researchers. unintended effects may be 'oversteering', either by forcing less competitive institutions to be closed down or by creating oligopolies whose once achieved position of supremacy cannot be challenged anymore by competitors. on the individual level the emergence of a kind of 'chart' of highly cited stars in science can already be observed (isi highlycited.com). with the spread of rankings the business administration paradigm and culture is diffused through the academic system. the commercialization of ranking is most pronounced in the dependence of the entire practice on commercial providers of the pertinent data. as products like ist's essential science indicators become available, their use in the context of evaluation tasks is increasing rapidly. the future of the higher education and research system rests on two pillars: traditional peer review and ranking. the goal must be to have a system of informed peer review which combines the two. however, the politicized use of numbers (citations, impact factors, funding etc.) appears unavoidable.

gusenbauer m.	google scholar to overshadow them all? comparing the sizes of 12 academic search engines and bibliographic databases	2019	scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-018-2958-5	information on the size of academic search engines and bibliographic databases (asebds) is often outdated or entirely unavailable. hence, it is difficult to assess the scope of specific databases, such as google scholar. while scientometric studies have estimated asebd sizes before, the methods employed were able to compare only a few databases. consequently, there is no up-to-date comparative information on the sizes of popular asebds. this study aims to fill this blind spot by providing a comparative picture of 12 of the most commonly used asebds. in doing so, we build on and refine previous scientometric research by counting query hit data as an indicator of the number of accessible records. iterative query optimization makes it possible to identify a maximum number of hits for most asebds. the results were validated in terms of their capacity to assess database size by comparing them with official information on database sizes or previous scientometric studies. the queries used here are replicable, so size information can be updated quickly. the findings provide first-time size estimates of proquest and ebscohost and indicate that google scholar's size might have been underestimated so far by more than 50%. by our estimation google scholar, with 389 million records, is currently the most comprehensive academic search engine.	academic search engine; academic bibliographic database; query hit count; size; iterative analysis; metrics; google scholar

butler l.	explaining australia's increased share of isi publications - the effects of a funding formula based on publication counts	2003	research policy	10.1016/s0048-7333(02)00007-0	australia's share of publications in the science citation index (sci) has increased by 25% in the last decade. the worrying aspect associated with this trend is the significant decline in citation impact australia is achieving relative to other countries. it has dropped from sixth position in a ranking of 11 oecd countries in 1988, to 10th position by 1993, and the distance from ninth place continues to widen. the increased publication activity came at a time when publication output was expected to decline due to pressures facing the higher education sector, which accounts for over two-thirds of australian publications. this paper examines possible methodological and contextual explanations of the trends in australia's presence in the sci, and undertakes a detailed comparison of two universities that introduced diverse research management strategies in the late 1980s. the conclusion reached is that the driving force behind the australian trends appears to lie with the increased culture of evaluation faced by the sector. significant funds are distributed to universities, and within universities, on the basis of aggregate publication counts, with little attention paid to the impact or quality of that output. in consequence, journal publication productivity has increased significantly in the last decade, but its impact has declined.

wang j.; veugelers r.; stephan p.	bias against novelty in science: a cautionary tale for users of bibliometric indicators	2017	research policy	10.1016/j.respol.2017.06.006	research which explores unchartered waters has a high potential for major impact but also carries a higher uncertainty of having impact. such explorative research is often described as taking a novel approach. this study examines the complex relationship between pursuing a novel approach and impact. viewing scientific research as a combinatorial process, we measure novelty in science by examining whether a published paper makes first-time-ever combinations of referenced journals, taking into account the difficulty of making such combinations. we apply this newly developed measure of novelty to all web of science research articles published in 2001 across all scientific disciplines. we find that highly novel papers, defined to be those that make more (distant) new combinations, deliver high gains to science: they are more likely to be a top 1% highly cited paper in the long run, to inspire follow-on highly cited research, and to be cited in a broader set of disciplines and in disciplines that are more distant from their home field. at the same time, novel research is also more risky, reflected by a higher variance in its citation performance. we also find strong evidence of delayed recognition of novel papers as novel papers are less likely to be top cited when using short time-windows. in addition, we find that novel research is significantly more highly cited in foreign fields but not in their home field. finally, novel papers are published in journals with a lower impact factor, compared with non-novel papers, ceteris paribus. these findings suggest that science policy, in particular funding decisions which rely on bibliometric indicators based on short-term citation counts and journal impact factors, may be biased against high risk/high gain novel research. the findings also caution against a mono-disciplinary approach in peer review to assess the true value of novel research.	novelty; breakthrough research; bibliometrics; evaluation; impact

garfield e.	from the science of science to scientometrics visualizing the history of science with <i>histcite</i> software	2009	journal of informetrics	10.1016/j.joi.2009.03.009	while issi was founded in 1993, scientometrics and bibliometrics are now at least half a century old. indeed, the field can be traced to early quantitative studies in the early 20th century. in the 1930s, it evolved to the science of science. the publication of j.d. bernal's social function of science in 1939 was a key transition point but the field lay dormant until after world war ii, when d.j.d. price's books science since babylon and little science, big science were published in 1961 and 1963. his role as the father of scientometrics is clearly evident by using the histcite software to visualize his impact as well as the subsequent impact of the journal scientometrics on the growth of the field. scientometrics owes its name to v.v. nalimov, the author of naukometriya, and to tibor braun who adapted the neologism for the journal. the primordial paper on citation indexing by garfield which appeared in science 1955 became a bridge between bernal and price. the timeline for the evolution of scientometrics is demonstrated by a histcite tabulation of the ranked citation index of the 100,000 references cited in the 3000 papers citing price.

von wartburg i.; teichert t.; rost k.	inventive progress measured by multi-stage patent citation analysis	2005	research policy	10.1016/j.respol.2005.08.001	studies of technological change constitute a field of growing importance and sophistication. in this paper we contribute to the discussion with a methodological reflection and application of multi-stage patent citation analysis for the measurement of inventive progress. investigating specific patterns of patent citation data, we conclude that single-stage citation analysis cannot reveal technological paths or lineages. therefore, one should also make use of indirect citations and bibliographical coupling. to measure aspects of cumulative inventive progress, we develop a shared specialization measure of patent families. we relate this measure to an expert rating of the technological value added in the field of variable valve actuation for internal combustion engines. in sum, the study presents promising evidence for multi-stage patent citation analysis in order to explain aspects of technological change.

cronin b.	bibliometrics and beyond: some thoughts on web-based citation analysis	2001	journal of information science	10.1177/016555150102700101	the idea of a unified citation index to the literature of science was first outlined by eugene garfield [i] in 1955 in the journal science. science citation index has since established itself as the gold standard for scientific information retrieval. it has also become the database of choice for citation analysts and evaluative bibliometricians worldwide. as scientific publication moves to the web, and novel approaches to scholarly communication and peer review establish themselves, new methods of citation and link analysis will emerge to capture often liminal expressions of peer esteem, influence and approbation. the web thus affords bibliometricians rich opportunities to apply and adapt their techniques to new contexts and content: the age of 'bibliometric spectroscopy' [2] is dawning.	
ninkov a.; frank j.r.; maggio l.a.	bibliometrics: methods for studying academic publishing	2022	perspectives on medical education	10.1007/s40037-021-00695-4	bibliometrics is the study of academic publishing that uses statistics to describe publishing trends and to highlight relationships between published works. likened to epidemiology, researchers seek to answer questions about a field based on data about publications (e.g., authors, topics, funding) in the same way that an epidemiologist queries patient data to understand the health of a population. in this eye opener, the authors introduce bibliometrics and define its key terminology and concepts, including relational and evaluative bibliometrics. readers are introduced to common bibliometric methods and their related strengths and weaknesses. the authors provide examples of bibliometrics applied in health professions education and propose potential future research directions. health professions educators are consumers of bibliometric reports and can adopt its methodologies for future studies.	bibliometrics; scholarly communication; information science

piwowar h.a.; vision t.j.	data reuse and the open data citation advantage	2013	peerj	10.7717/peerj.175	background. attribution to the original contributor upon reuse of published data is important both as a reward for data creators and to document the provenance of research findings. previous studies have found that papers with publicly available datasets receive a higher number of citations than similar studies without available data. however, few previous analyses have had the statistical power to control for the many variables known to predict citation rate, which has led to uncertain estimates of the citation benefit. furthermore, little is known about patterns in data reuse over time and across datasets. method and results. here, we look at citation rates while controlling for many known citation predictors and investigate the variability of data reuse. in a multivariate regression on 10,555 studies that created gene expression microarray data, we found that studies that made data available in a public repository received 9% (95% confidence interval: 5% to 13%) more citations than similar studies for which the data was not made available. date of publication, journal impact factor, open access status, number of authors, first and last author publication history, corresponding author country, institution citation history, and study topic were included as covariates. the citation benefit varied with date of dataset deposition: a citation benefit was most clear for papers published in 2004 and 2005, at about 30%. authors published most papers using their own datasets within two years of their first publication on the dataset, whereas data reuse papers published by third-party investigators continued to accumulate for at least six years. to study patterns of data reuse directly, we compiled 9,724 instances of third party data reuse via mention of geo or arrayexpress accession numbers in the full text of papers. the level of third-party data use was high: for 100 datasets deposited in year 0, we estimated that 40 papers in pubmed reused a dataset by year 2, 100 by year 4, and more than 150 data reuse papers had been published by year 5. data reuse was distributed across a broad base of datasets: a very conservative estimate found that 20% of the datasets deposited between 2003 and 2007 had been reused at least once by third parties. conclusion. after accounting for other factors affecting citation rate, we find a robust citation benefit from open data, although a smaller one than previously reported. we conclude there is a direct effect of third-party data reuse that persists for years beyond the time when researchers have published most of the papers reusing their own data. other factors that may also contribute to the citation benefit are considered. we further conclude that, at least for gene expression microarray data, a substantial fraction of archived datasets are reused, and that the intensity of dataset reuse has been steadily increasing since 2003.	data reuse; data repositories; gene expression microarray; incentives; data archiving; open data; bibliometrics; information science

evangelopoulos n.; zhang x.n.; prybutok v.r.	latent semantic analysis: five methodological recommendations	2012	european journal of information systems	10.1057/ejis.2010.61	the recent influx in generation, storage, and availability of textual data presents researchers with the challenge of developing suitable methods for their analysis. latent semantic analysis (lsa), a member of a family of methodological approaches that offers an opportunity to address this gap by describing the semantic content in textual data as a set of vectors, was pioneered by researchers in psychology, information retrieval, and bibliometrics. lsa involves a matrix operation called singular value decomposition, an extension of principal component analysis. lsa generates latent semantic dimensions that are either interpreted, if the researcher's primary interest lies with the understanding of the thematic structure in the textual data, or used for purposes of clustering, categorization, and predictive modeling, if the interest lies with the conversion of raw text into numerical data, as a precursor to subsequent analysis. this paper reviews five methodological issues that need to be addressed by the researcher who will embark on lsa. we examine the dilemmas, present the choices, and discuss the considerations under which good methodological decisions are made. we illustrate these issues with the help of four small studies, involving the analysis of abstracts for papers published in the european journal of information systems. european journal of information systems (2012) 21, 70-86. doi:10.1057/ejis.2010.61; published online 21 december 2010	text mining; analysis of textual data; singular value decomposition; clustering; factor analysis

jons h.; hoyler m.	global geographies of higher education: the perspective of world university rankings	2013	geoforum	10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.12.014	this paper contributes to emerging debates about uneven global geographies of higher education through a critical analysis of world university rankings. drawing on recent work in geography, international higher education and bibliometrics, the paper examines two of the major international ranking schemes that have had significant public impact in the context of the on-going neoliberalization of higher education. we argue that the emergence of these global rankings reflects a scalar shift in the geopolitics and geoeconomics of higher education from the national to the global that prioritizes academic practices and discourses conducted in particular places and fields of research. our analysis illustrates how the substantial variation in ranking criteria produces not only necessarily partial but also very specific global geographies of higher education. in comparison, these reveal a wider tension in the knowledge-based economy between established knowledge centers in europe and the united states and emerging knowledge hubs in asia pacific. an analysis of individual ranking criteria, however, suggests that other measures and subject-specific perspectives would produce very different landscapes of higher education.

van eck n.j.; waltman l.	bibliometric mapping of the computational intelligence field	2007	international journal of uncertainty fuzziness and knowledge-based systems	10.1142/s0218488507004911	in this paper, a bibliometric study of the computational intelligence field is presented. bibliometric maps showing the associations between the main concepts in the field are provided for the periods 1996-2000 and 2001-2005. both the current structure of the field and the evolution of the field over the last decade are analyzed. in addition, a number of emerging areas in the fild are identified. it turns out that the computational intelligence can best be seen as a field that is structured around four important types of problems, namely control problems, classification problems, regression problemsm and optimization problems. within the computational intelligence field, the neural networks and fuzzy systems sudfields are fairly intertwined, whereas the evolutionary computation subfield has a relatively independent postion.	bibliometrics; bibliometric mapping; computational intelligence; neural networks; fuzzy systems; evolutionary computation
diem a.; wolter s.c.	the use of bibliometrics to measure research performance in education sciences	2013	research in higher education	10.1007/s11162-012-9264-5	this paper investigates the fitness-for-purpose and soundness of bibliometric parameters for measuring and elucidating the research performance of individual researchers in the field of education sciences in switzerland. in order to take into account the specificities of publication practices of researchers in education sciences, the analyses are based on two separate databases: web of science and google scholar. both databases show a very unequal distribution of the individual research output, and the indicators used to measure research performance (quantity of publications and citation impact) from the two data sources are highly positively correlated. however, individual characteristics of the researchers, such as age, gender and academic position, that serve to explain the great variance in research performance, can only be identified if the web of science is used as a benchmark of research performance. the results indicate that google scholar is so inclusive that it impedes a meaningful interpretation of the data. however, the web of science inclusion policy for journals is also associated with certain shortcomings that put some researchers at an unjustified disadvantage. therefore, problems currently exist in regard to both citation databases when used to benchmark individual research performance.	bibliometrics; education sciences; research performance; scientometric methods; science research

franceschet m.; costantini a.	the effect of scholar collaboration on impact and quality of academic papers	2010	journal of informetrics	10.1016/j.joi.2010.06.003	we study how scholar collaboration varies across disciplines in science, social science, arts and humanities and the effects of author collaboration on impact and quality of coauthored papers. impact is measured with the aid of citations collected by papers, while quality is determined by the judgements expressed by peer reviewers. to this end, we take advantage of the dataset provided by the first-ever national research assessment exercise of italian universities, which involved 20 disciplinary areas, 102 research structures, 18,500 research products, and 6661 peer reviewers. collaboration intensity neatly varies across disciplines: it is inescapable is most sciences and negligible in most humanities. we measured a general positive association between cardinality of the author set of a paper and citation count as well as peer quality of the contribution. the correlation is stronger when the affiliations of authors are heterogeneous. there exist, however, notable and interesting counter-examples.

aguillo i.f.	is google scholar useful for bibliometrics? a webometric analysis	2012	scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-011-0582-8	google scholar, the academic bibliographic database provided free-of-charge by the search engine giant google, has been suggested as an alternative or complementary resource to the commercial citation databases like web of knowledge (isi/thomson) or scopus (elsevier). in order to check the usefulness of this database for bibliometric analysis, and especially research evaluation, a novel approach is introduced. instead of names of authors or institutions, a webometric analysis of academic web domains is performed. the bibliographic records for 225 top level web domains (tld), 19,240 university and 6,380 research centres institutional web domains have been collected from the google scholar database. about 63.8% of the records are hosted in generic domains like .com or .org, confirming that most of the scholar data come from large commercial or non-profit sources. considering only institutions with at least one record, one-third of the other items (10.6% from the global) are hosted by the 10,442 universities, while 3,901 research centres amount for an additional 7.9% from the total. the individual analysis show that universities from china, brazil, spain, taiwan or indonesia are far better ranked than expected. in some cases, large international or national databases, or repositories are responsible for the high numbers found. however, in many others, the local contents, including papers in low impact journals, popular scientific literature, and unpublished reports or teaching supporting materials are clearly overrepresented. google scholar lacks the quality control needed for its use as a bibliometric tool; the larger coverage it provides consists in some cases of items not comparable with those provided by other similar databases.	google scholar; bibliometrics; webometrics; geographical coverage; top institutions; quality control
chen g.; xiao l.	selecting publication keywords for domain analysis in bibliometrics: a comparison of three methods	2016	journal of informetrics	10.1016/j.joi.2016.01.006	publication keywords have been widely utilized to reveal the knowledge structure of research domains. an important but under-addressed problem is the decision of which keywords should be retained as analysis objects after a great number of keywords are gathered from domain publications. in this paper, we discuss the problems with the traditional term frequency (tf) method and introduce two alternative methods: tf-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and tf-keyword activity index (tf-kai). these two methods take into account keyword discrimination by considering their frequency both in and out of the domain. to test their performance, the keywords they select in china's digital library domain are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. the evaluation results show that the tf-kai method performs the best: it can retain keywords that match expert selection much better and reveal the research specialization of the domain with more details.

narin f.; hamilton k.s.	bibliometric performance measures	1996	scientometrics	10.1007/bf02129596	three different types of bibliometrics - literature bibliometrics, patent bibliometrics, and linkage bibliometric can all be used to address various government performance and results questions. applications of these three bibliometric types will be described within the framework of weinberg's internal and external criteria, whether the work being done is good science, efficiently and effectively done, and whether it is important science from a technological viewpoint. within all bibliometrics the fundamental assumption is that the frequency with which a set of papers or patents is cited is a measure of the impact or influence of the set of papers. the literature bibliometric indicators are counts of publications and citations received in the scientific literature and various derived indicators including such phenomena as cross-sectoral citation, coauthorship and concentration within influential journals. one basic observation of literature bibliometrics, which carries over to patent bibliometrics, is that of highly skewed distributions - with a relatively small number of high-impact patents and papers, and large numbers of patents and papers of minimal impact. the key measure is whether an agency is producing or supporting highly cited papers and patents. the final set of data are in the area of linkage bibliometrics, looking at citations from patents to scientific papers. these are particularly relevant to the external criteria, in that it is quire obvious that institutions and supporting agencies whose papers are highly cited in patents are making measurable contributions to a nation's technological progress.

henriksen d.	the rise in co-authorship in the social sciences (1980-2013)	2016	scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-016-1849-x	this article examines the rise in co-authorship in the social sciences over a 34-year period. it investigates the development in co-authorship in different research fields and discusses how the methodological differences in these research fields together with changes in academia affect the tendency to co-author articles. the study is based on bibliographic data about 4.5 million peer review articles published in the period 1980-2013 and indexed in the 56 subject categories of the web of science's social science citation index. the results show a rise in the average number of authors, share of co-authored and international co-authored articles in the majority of the subject categories. however, the results also show that there are great disciplinary differences to the extent of the rises in co-authorship. the subject categories with a great share of international coauthored articles have generally experienced an increase in co-authorship, but increasing international collaboration is not the only factor influencing the rise in co-authorship. hence, the most substantial rises have occurred in subject categories, where the research often is based on the use of experiments, large data set, statistical methods and/or team-production models.	co-authorship; social sciences; research collaboration; bibliometrics
meyer m.	what is special about patent citations? differences between scientific and patent citations	2000	scientometrics	10.1023/a:1005613325648	the emergence of patent bibliometrics as a new branch of scientometrics necessitates a deeper understanding of the relationship between patents and papers. as this connection is established through the linkage between patents and research papers, one must have a clear idea of similarities and differences between patent and paper citations. this paper will investigate to what extent one can not only apply bibliometric methods to patents but also extend the existing interpretative framework for citations in research papers to the field of patent citations. after pointing out some parallels in the debates about the nature of citations in patents and scientific articles, the paper outlines those parts of bibliometric theory covering scientific citations that could be relevant to patent citations too. then it highlights the specialties and peculiarities of patent citations. one major conclusion is that the general nature of a common framework for both scientific and patent citations would severely limit its usefulness, but research on academic citations might still be a great source of inspiration to the study of patent citations.

godin b.	on the origins of bibliometrics	2006	scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-006-0086-0	among the many statistics on science, called scientometrics, bibliometrics holds a privileged place. bibliometrics is one of the few subfields concerned with measuring the output side of science. according to most histories, bibliometrics owes its systematic development mainly to d.j.d. price and eugene garfield, as founders. the few works conducted before the 1950s are usually relegated to prehistory. this paper documents how the systematic counting of publications originated with psychologists. in the early 1900s, psychologists began collecting statistics on their discipline. publications came to be counted in addresses, reviews and histories of psychology for several decades. the aim was to contribute to the advancement of psychology. far from being a negligible output of a prehistoric type, both the volume and the systematicness of these efforts are witnesses to what should be considered as pioneering work, and their authors considered as forerunners to bibliometrics.

lariviere v.; gingras y.	the impact factor's matthew effect: a natural experiment in bibliometrics	2010	journal of the american society for information science and technology	10.1002/asi.21232	since the publication of robert k. merton's theory of cumulative advantage in science (matthew effect), several empirical studies have tried to measure its presence at the level of papers, individual researchers, institutions, or countries. however, these studies seldom control for the intrinsic quality of papers or of researchers-better (however defined) papers or researchers could receive higher citation rates because they are indeed of better quality. using an original method for controlling the intrinsic value of papers-identical duplicate papers published in different journals with different impact factors-this paper shows that the journal in which papers are published have a strong influence on their citation rates, as duplicate papers published in high-impact journals obtain, on average, twice as many citations as their identical counterparts published in journals with lower impact factors. the intrinsic value of a paper is thus not the only reason a given paper gets cited or not, there is a specific matthew effect attached to journals and this gives to papers published there an added value over and above their intrinsic quality.

haustein s.	grand challenges in altmetrics: heterogeneity, data quality and dependencies	2016	scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-016-1910-9	with increasing uptake among researchers, social media are finding their way into scholarly communication and, under the umbrella term altmetrics, are starting to be utilized in research evaluation. fueled by technological possibilities and an increasing demand to demonstrate impact beyond the scientific community, altmetrics have received great attention as potential democratizers of the scientific reward system and indicators of societal impact. this paper focuses on the current challenges for altmetrics. heterogeneity, data quality and particular dependencies are identified as the three major issues and discussed in detail with an emphasis on past developments in bibliometrics. the heterogeneity of altmetrics reflects the diversity of the acts and online events, most of which take place on social media platforms. this heterogeneity has made it difficult to establish a common definition or conceptual framework. data quality issues become apparent in the lack of accuracy, consistency and replicability of various altmetrics, which is largely affected by the dynamic nature of social media events. furthermore altmetrics are shaped by technical possibilities and are particularly dependent on the availability of apis and dois, strongly dependent on data providers and aggregators, and potentially influenced by the technical affordances of underlying platforms.	big data; data integration; research and innovation policy; data quality; comparability; standardization; concordance tables; modularization; interoperability; research assessment

lai k.k.; wu s.j.	using the patent co-citation approach to establish a new patent classification system	2005	information processing & management	10.1016/j.ipm.2003.11.004	the paper proposes a new approach to create a patent classification system to replace the ipc or upc system for conducting patent analysis and management. the new approach is based on co-citation analysis of bibliometrics. the traditional approach for management of patents, which is based on either the ipc or upc, is too general to meet the needs of specific industries. in addition, some patents are placed in incorrect categories, making it difficult for enterprises to carry out r&d planning, technology positioning, patent strategy-making and technology forecasting. therefore, it is essential to develop a patent classification system that is adaptive to the characteristics of a specific industry. the analysis of this approach is divided into three phases. phase i selects appropriate databases to conduct patent searches according to the subject and objective of this study and then select basic patents. phase ii uses the co-cited frequency of the basic patent pairs to assess their similarity. phase iii uses factor analysis to establish a classification system and assess the efficiency of the proposed approach. the main contribution of this approach is to develop a patent classification system based on patent similarities to assist patent manager in understanding the basic patents for a specific industry, the relationships among categories of technologies and the evolution of a technology category.

hjorland b.	citation analysis: a social and dynamic approach to knowledge organization	2013	information processing & management	10.1016/j.ipm.2013.07.001	knowledge organization (ko) and bibliometrics have traditionally been seen as separate subfields of library and information science, but bibliometric techniques make it possible to identify candidate terms for thesauri and to organize knowledge by relating scientific papers and authors to each other and thereby indicating kinds of relatedness and semantic distance. it is therefore important to view bibliometric techniques as a family of approaches to ko in order to illustrate their relative strengths and weaknesses. the subfield of bibliometrics concerned with citation analysis forms a distinct approach to ko which is characterized by its social, historical and dynamic nature, its close dependence on scholarly literature and its explicit kind of literary warrant. the two main methods, co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling represent different things and thus neither can be considered superior for all purposes. the main difference between traditional knowledge organization systems (koss) and maps based on citation analysis is that the first group represents intellectual koss, whereas the second represents social koss. for this reason bibliometric maps cannot be expected ever to be fully equivalent to scholarly taxonomies, but they are - along with other forms of koss - valuable tools for assisting users' to orient themselves to the information ecology. like other koss, citation-based maps cannot be neutral but will always be based on researchers' decisions, which tend to favor certain interests and views at the expense of others.

caviggioli f.	technology fusion: identification and analysis of the drivers of technology convergence using patent data	2016	technovation	10.1016/j.technovation.2016.04.003	the concepts of technology convergence or technology fusion describe the phenomenon of technology overlap. despite evidence of the higher value associated to interdisciplinary research and cross-industry innovation, few studies have investigated the characteristics of technology fusion based on patent data. this study identifies new cases of convergence relying on the international patent classification (ipc) of patents filed at the european patent office between 1991 and 2007: the first occurrence of a patent incorporating a combination of ipc subclasses signals a new instance of fusion. duration models are employed to investigate the impact of field level characteristics derived from patent bibliometrics on the likelihood of identifying a new fusion. the results show that merges are more frequent if the focal technology fields are closely related (based on a higher number of cross citations), are characterized by wide technological scope, and are the result of an inter-firm collaboration. in contrast to previous findings, the results show that the more complex the technologies involved, the less the likelihood of their convergence or fusion. the correlation between fusion likelihood and the characteristics of the merging fields could help managers and policymakers to predict the emergence of new technology areas.

yoon j.; kim k.	identifying rapidly evolving technological trends for r&d planning using sao-based semantic patent networks	2011	scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-011-0383-0	patents constitute an up-to-date source of competitive intelligence in technological development; thus, patent analysis has been a vital tool for identifying technological trends. patent citation analysis is easy to use, but fundamentally has two main limitations: (1) new patents tend to be less cited than old ones and may miss citations to contemporary patents; (2) citation-based analysis cannot be used for patents in databases which do not require citations. naturally, citation-based analysis tends to underestimate the importance of new patents and may not work in rapidly-evolving industries in which technology life-cycles are shortening and new inventions are increasingly patented worldwide. as a remedy, this paper proposes a patent network based on semantic patent analysis using subject-action-object (sao) structures. sao structures represent the explicit relationships among components used in a patent, and are considered to represent key concepts of the patent or the expertise of the inventor. based on the internal similarities between patents, the patent network provides the up-to-date status of a given technology. furthermore, this paper suggests new indices to identify the technological importance of patents, the characteristics of patent clusters, and the technological capabilities of competitors. the proposed method is illustrated using patents related to synthesis of carbon nanotubes. we expect that the proposed procedure and analysis will be incorporated into technology planning processes to assist experts such as researchers and r&d policy makers in rapidly-evolving industries.	patent mining; semantic patent similarity; subject-action-object (sao) structures; patent network; research and development (r&d) trend; natural language processing (nlp)

hammarfelt b.	using altmetrics for assessing research impact in the humanities	2014	scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-014-1261-3	the prospects of altmetrics are especially encouraging for research fields in the humanities that currently are difficult to study using established bibliometric methods. yet, little is known about the altmetric impact of research fields in the humanities. consequently, this paper analyses the altmetric coverage and impact of humanities-oriented articles and books published by swedish universities during 2012. some of the most common altmetric sources are examined using a sample of 310 journal articles and 54 books. mendeley has the highest coverage of journal articles (61%) followed by twitter (21%) while very few of the publications are mentioned in blogs or on facebook. books, on the other hand, are quite often tweeted while both mendeley's and the novel data source library thing's coverage is low. many of the problems of applying bibliometrics to the humanities are also relevant for altmetric approaches; the importance of non-journal publications, the reliance on print as well the limited coverage of non-english language publications. however, the continuing development and diversification of methods suggests that altmetrics could evolve into a valuable tool for assessing research in the humanities.	altmetrics; bibliometrics; humanities; mendeley; twitter; library thing

meyer m.	are patenting scientists the better scholars? an exploratory comparison of inventor-authors with their non-inventing peers in nano-science and technology	2006	research policy	10.1016/j.respol.2006.09.013	this paper explores the relationship between scientific publication and patenting activity. more specifically, it examines for the field of nano-science and nano-technology whether researchers who both publish and patent are more productive and more highly cited than their peers who concentrate on scholarly publication in communicating their research results. this study is based on an analysis of the nano-science publications and nano-technology patents of a small set of european countries. while only a very few nano-scientists appear to hold patents in nano-technology, many nano-inventors seem to be actively publishing nano-science research. overall, the patenting scientists appear to outperform their solely publishing (non-inventing) peers in terms of publication counts and citation frequency. however, a closer examination of the highly active and highly cited nano-authors points to a slightly different situation. while still over-represented among the highly cited authors, inventor-authors appear not to be among the most highly cited authors in that category, with a single notable exception. one policy implication is that, generally speaking, patenting activity does not appear to have an adverse impact on the publication and citation performance of researchers.

(2013), and replicated by boyack and klavans (2014), this article tests for novelty and conventionality in international research collaboration. scholars have found that coauthored articles are more novel and have suggested that diverse groups have a greater chance of producing creative work. as such, we expected to find that international collaboration tends to produce more novel research. using data from web of science and scopus in 2005, we failed to show that international collaboration tends to produce more novel articles. in fact, international collaboration appears to produce less novel and more conventional knowledge combinations. transaction costs and communication barriers to international collaboration may suppress novelty. higher citations to international work may be explained by an audience effect, where more authors from more countries results in greater access to a larger citing community. the findings are consistent with explanations of growth in international collaboration that posit a social dynamic of preferential attachment based upon reputation.	international collaboration; novelty; creativity; bibliometrics; public policy

lariviere v.; sugimoto c.r.; cronin b.	a bibliometric chronicling of library and information science's first hundred years	2012	journal of the american society for information science and technology	10.1002/asi.22645	this paper presents a condensed history of library and information science (lis) over the course of more than a century using a variety of bibliometric measures. it examines in detail the variable rate of knowledge production in the field, shifts in subject coverage, the dominance of particular publication genres at different times, prevailing modes of production, interactions with other disciplines, and, more generally, observes how the field has evolved. it shows that, despite a striking growth in the number of journals, papers, and contributing authors, a decrease was observed in the field's market-share of all social science and humanities research. collaborative authorship is now the norm, a pattern seen across the social sciences. the idea of boundary crossing was also examined: in 2010, nearly 60% of authors who published in lis also published in another discipline. this high degree of permeability in lis was also demonstrated through reference and citation practices: lis scholars now cite and receive citations from other fields more than from lis itself. two major structural shifts are revealed in the data: in 1960, lis changed from a professional field focused on librarianship to an academic field focused on information and use; and in 1990, lis began to receive a growing number of citations from outside the field, notably from computer science and management, and saw a dramatic increase in the number of authors contributing to the literature of the field.	information science history; bibliometrics

mucina l.	classification of vegetation: past, present and future	1997	journal of vegetation science	10.2307/3237019	this paper is a report on the past, status-quo and perspectives of vegetation classification, still a major occupation of many vegetation scientists. the history of vegetation classification is discussed against a background of several controversial issues such as the problem of continuum vs. discontinuum, naturalness vs. arbitrariness of the nature of plant communities, universality vs. ad hoc character of syntaxonomic schemes, as well as classical versus numerical approaches to data analysis for classification purposes. the development of the methodology of vegetation science and the present image of vegetation classification is documented by a bibliometric analysis of the publication record of four major journals: journal of vegetation science; vegetatio, phytocoenologia and tuexenia. this analysis revealed a persisting controversy between traditional and numerical approaches to vegetation classification. a series of important changes in vegetation science (foundation of new journals, change of editorial policy by the established, important meetings) punctuate a period called the 'innovation period'. several trends in the development of methods of vegetation systematics are summarized under the headings formalism, pluralism, functionalism, pragmatism and imdeterminism. some new features, such as the development and improvement of numerical tools, use of large data banks and attempts to summarize the theory of vegetation classification are discussed. the new growth-form system of barkman initiated a revival of physiognomy-based vegetation classification. within this framework the use of the character-type concept and the development of new numerical methods for studying the hierarchical structure of character-set types seems to be a promising approach. the achievements of population biology and ecophysiology have affected vegetation science by emphasizing the functionality of species within plant communities. the use of guilds and other functional groups has experienced an increasing interest from vegetation scientists. applied in vegetation science, fuzzy-set theory has bridged the techniques of classification and ordination of plant communities.	bibliometrics; braun-blanquet approach; formalism; functionality; innovation period; numerical syntaxonomy; scientometry; vegetation theory

meerow s.; newell j.p.	resilience and complexity a bibliometric review and prospects for industrial ecology	2015	journal of industrial ecology	10.1111/jiec.12252	resilience is an increasingly popular concept in academic research and public discourse and is closely connected to complex systems theory. this article reviews research on resilience and complexity in industrial ecology and the broader academy by conducting a bibliometric analysis of the academic literature over a 40-year period (1973-2014). the review revealed a large body of scholarship composed of five clearly identifiable intellectual communities, with resilience theory from ecology especially influential. based on the study of ecosystems, these scholars conceptualize resilience as a dynamic and adaptive property of systems with multiple stable states that evolve over time. in comparison, resilience research in industrial ecology is limited and underdeveloped. bibliometric analysis of this literature yielded just 37 publications and a scholarly network with no well-formulated research communities. this contrasts with industrial ecology scholarship on sustainability; a similar search yielded 1,581 publications. given the emerging importance of the resilience concept and its relevance for sustainability issues, industrial ecology should expand research efforts in this area. the growing body of industrial ecology scholarship on complex systems provides a foundation to do so, as does the field's long-standing practice of using ecological principles to inform the study and design of industrial ecosystems. the article concludes by discussing how industrial ecology would benefit from incorporating principles of dynamic resilience and, conversely, how industrial ecology approaches could advance broader resilience scholarship.	bibliometrics; complex systems; complexity; industrial ecology; resilience; sustainability

georghiou l.; roessner d.	evaluating technology programs: tools and methods	2000	research policy	10.1016/s0048-7333(99)00094-3	this article reviews the analytical tools, methods, and designs being used to evaluate public programs intended to stimulate technological advance. the review is organized around broad policy categories rather than particular types of policy intervention, because methods used are rarely chosen independent of context. the categories addressed include publicly-supported research conducted in universities and public sector research organizations; evaluations of linkages, especially those programs seeking to promote academic-industrial and public-private partnerships; and the evaluation of diffusion and industrial extension programs. the internal evaluation procedures of science such as peer review and bibliometrics are not covered, nor are methods used to evaluate projects and individuals ex ante. among the conclusion is the observation that evaluation work has had less of an impact in the literature than it deserves, in part because much of the most detailed and valuable work is not easily obtainable. a second conclusion is that program evaluations and performance reviews, which have distinctive objectives, measures, and tools, are becoming entangled, with the lines between the two becoming blurred. finally, new approaches to measuring the payoffs from research that focus on linkages between knowledge producers and users, and on the characteristics of research networks, appear promising as the limitations of the production function and related methods have become apparent.

petersen a.m.	quantifying the impact of weak, strong, and super ties in scientific careers	2015	proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america	10.1073/pnas.1501444112	scientists are frequently faced with the important decision to start or terminate a creative partnership. this process can be influenced by strategic motivations, as early career researchers are pursuers, whereas senior researchers are typically attractors, of new collaborative opportunities. focusing on the longitudinal aspects of scientific collaboration, we analyzed 473 collaboration profiles using an egocentric perspective that accounts for researcher-specific characteristics and provides insight into a range of topics, from career achievement and sustainability to team dynamics and efficiency. from more than 166,000 collaboration records, we quantify the frequency distributions of collaboration duration and tie strength, showing that collaboration networks are dominated by weak ties characterized by high turnover rates. we use analytic extreme value thresholds to identify a new class of indispensable super ties, the strongest of which commonly exhibit >50% publication overlap with the central scientist. the prevalence of super ties suggests that they arise from career strategies based upon cost, risk, and reward sharing and complementary skill matching. we then use a combination of descriptive and panel regression methods to compare the subset of publications coauthored with a super tie to the subset without one, controlling for pertinent features such as career age, prestige, team size, and prior group experience. we find that super ties contribute to above-average productivity and a 17% citation increase per publication, thus identifying these partnerships-the analog of life partners-as a major factor in science career development.	computational social science; cooperation; team science; career evaluation; bibliometrics
abramo g.; d'angelo c.a.; caprasecca a.	allocative efficiency in public research funding: can bibliometrics help?	2009	research policy	10.1016/j.respol.2008.11.001	the use of outcome control modes of research evaluation exercises is ever more frequent. they are conceived as tools to stimulate increased levels of research productivity, and to guide choices in allocating components of government research budgets for publicly funded institutions. there are several contributions in the literature that compare the different methodological approaches that policy makers could adopt for these exercises, however the comparisons are limited to only a few disciplines. this work, examining the case of the whole of the hard sciences of the italian academic system, makes a comparison between results obtained from peer review type of evaluations (as adopted by the ministry of universities and research) and those possible from a bibliometric approach (as developed by the authors). the aim is to understand to what extent bibliometric methodology, which is noted as relatively inexpensive, time-saving and exhaustive, can complement and integrate peer review methodology in research evaluation.

sharifi a.	urban sustainability assessment: an overview and bibliometric analysis	2021	ecological indicators	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107102	following the recognition of the significance of urban areas for achieving sustainable development in the late 1980's, first studies on `urban sustainability assessment' were published in early 1990s. since then, the field has grown rapidly, with over 300 papers published annually in recent years. the main objective of this study is to present a bibliometric analysis of about thirty years of research on urban sustainability assessment. the literature database includes 3877 articles published in the web of science. vosviewer and scimat are two science mapping software tools that were utilized for this purpose. vosviewer is utilized to detect major focus areas and to identify influential authors, publications, and journals using various network analysis techniques such as term co-occurrence, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling. also, scimat is used to understand how the intellectual base of the field has evolved over time and what are the major themes that have contributed to this evolution. for this purpose, the study interval was divided into four sub-periods (i.e., 1991-2000; 2001-2009; 2010-2015; and 2016-2020). results show that this field has initially been mainly focused on few themes but has later become more diversified to acknowledge the multi-dimensional characteristics of urban sustainability. despite this, environmental aspects are still dominant and major socio-economic issues such as equity, justice, and public engagement are not well represented. sustainable development indicators, energy, green infrastructure, water, land use, and urban design are major thematic areas, with the first three playing more important roles in structuring the development of the field. this study can be used as a point of reference for those interested in gaining more knowledge about urban sustainability assessment and its evolution.	sustainable development; urban sustainability; sustainability assessment; cities; indicators; bibliometrics

wallace m.l.; lariviere v.; gingras y.	modeling a century of citation distributions	2009	journal of informetrics	10.1016/j.joi.2009.03.010	the prevalence of uncited papers or of highly cited papers, with respect to the bulk of publications, provides important clues as to the dynamics of scientific research. using 25 million papers and 600 million references from the web of science over the 1900-2006 period, this paper proposes a simple model based on a random selection process to explain the uncitedness phenomenon and its decline over the years. we show that the proportion of cited papers is a function of (1) the number of articles available (the competing papers), (2) the number of citing papers and (3) the number of references they contain. using uncitedness as a departure point, we demonstrate the utility of the stretched-exponential function and a form of the tsallis q-exponential function to fit complete citation distributions over the 20th century. as opposed to simple power-law fits, for instance, both these approaches are shown to be empirically well-grounded and robust enough to better understand citation dynamics at the aggregate level. on the basis of these models, we provide quantitative evidence and provisional explanations for an important shift in citation practices around 1960. we also propose a revision of the citation classic category as a set of articles which is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the field.

wang j.; shapira p.	funding acknowledgement analysis: an enhanced tool to investigate research sponsorship impacts: the case of nanotechnology	2011	scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-011-0362-5	there is increasing interest in assessing how sponsored research funding influences the development and trajectory of science and technology. traditionally, linkages between research funding and subsequent results are hard to track, often requiring access to separate funding or performance reports released by researchers or sponsors. tracing research sponsorship and output linkages is even more challenging when researchers receive multiple funding awards and collaborate with a variety of differentially-sponsored research colleagues. this article presents a novel bibliometric approach to undertaking funding acknowledgement analysis which links research outputs with their funding sources. using this approach in the context of nanotechnology research, the article probes the funding patterns of leading countries and agencies including patterns of cross-border research sponsorship. we identify more than 91,500 nanotechnology articles published worldwide during a 12-month period in 2008-2009. about 67% of these publications include funding acknowledgements information. we compare articles reporting funding with those that do not (for reasons that may include reliance on internal core-funding rather than external awards as well as omissions in reporting). while we find some country and field differences, we judge that the level of reporting of funding sources is sufficiently high to provide a basis for analysis. the funding acknowledgement data is used to compare nanotechnology funding policies and programs in selected countries and to examine their impacts on scientific output. we also examine the internationalization of research funding through the interplay of various funding sources at national and organizational levels. we find that while most nanotechnology funding is nationally-oriented, internationalization and knowledge exchange does occur as researchers collaborate across borders. our method offers a new approach not only in identifying the funding sources of publications but also in feasibly undertaking large-scale analyses across scientific fields, institutions and countries.	funding acknowledgement analysis; research funding; research sponsorship; nanotechnology; research outputs; publications; bibliometrics
behzadi p.; garcia-perdomo h.a.; karpinski t.m.	toll-like receptors: general molecular and structural biology	2021	journal of immunology research	10.1155/2021/9914854	background/aim. toll-like receptors (tlrs) are pivotal biomolecules in the immune system. today, we are all aware of the importance of tlrs in bridging innate and adaptive immune system to each other. the tlrs are activated through binding to damage/danger-associated molecular patterns (damps), microbial/microbe-associated molecular patterns (mamps), pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps), and xenobiotic-associated molecular patterns (xamps). the immunogenetic molecules of tlrs have their own functions, structures, coreceptors, and ligands which make them unique. these properties of tlrs give us an opportunity to find out how we can employ this knowledge for ligand-drug discovery strategies to control tlrs functions and contribution, signaling pathways, and indirect activities. hence, the authors of this paper have a deep observation on the molecular and structural biology of human tlrs (htlrs). methods and materials. to prepare this paper and fulfill our goals, different search engines (e.g., google scholar), databases (e.g., medline), and websites (e.g., scopus) were recruited to search and find effective papers and investigations. to reach this purpose, we tried with papers published in the english language with no limitation in time. the icite bibliometrics was exploited to check the quality of the collected publications. results. each tlr molecule has its own molecular and structural biology, coreceptor(s), and abilities which make them unique or a complementary portion of the others. these immunogenetic molecules have remarkable roles and are much more important in different sections of immune and nonimmune systems rather than that we understand to date. conclusion. tlrs are suitable targets for ligand-drug discovery strategies to establish new therapeutics in the fields of infectious and autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other inflammatory diseases and disorders.

bornmann l.	validity of altmetrics data for measuring societal impact: a study using data from altmetric and f1000prime	2014	journal of informetrics	10.1016/j.joi.2014.09.007	can altmetric data be validly used for the measurement of societal impact? the current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (f1000, altmetric, and an in-house database based on web of science). in the f1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. the results show that papers with the tag good for teaching do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag - if the quality of the papers is controlled. at the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is specifically scientifically oriented (new finding). the findings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research should lead to societal impact. if altmetric data is to be used for the measurement of societal impact, the question arises of its normalization. in bibliometrics, citations are normalized for the papers' subject area and publication year. this study has taken a second analytic step involving a possible normalization of altmetric data. as the results show there are particular scientific topics which are of especial interest for a wide audience. since these more or less interesting topics are not completely reflected in thomson reuters' journal sets, a normalization of altmetric data should not be based on the level of subject categories, but on the level of topics.

suominen a.; toivanen h.	map of science with topic modeling: comparison of unsupervised learning and human-assigned subject classification	2016	journal of the association for information science and technology	10.1002/asi.23596	the delineation of coordinates is fundamental for the cartography of science, and accurate and credible classification of scientific knowledge presents a persistent challenge in this regard. we present a map of finnish science based on unsupervised-learning classification, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach vis-a-vis those generated by human reasoning. we conclude that from theoretical and practical perspectives there exist several challenges for human reasoning-based classification frameworks of scientific knowledge, as they typically try to fit new-to-the-world knowledge into historical models of scientific knowledge, and cannot easily be deployed for new large-scale data sets. automated classification schemes, in contrast, generate classification models only from the available text corpus, thereby identifying credibly novel bodies of knowledge. they also lend themselves to versatile large-scale data analysis, and enable a range of big data possibilities. however, we also argue that it is neither possible nor fruitful to declare one or another method a superior approach in terms of realism to classify scientific knowledge, and we believe that the merits of each approach are dependent on the practical objectives of analysis.	machine learning; automatic classification; text mining

bornmann l.; marx w.	methods for the generation of normalized citation impact scores in bibliometrics: which method best reflects the judgements of experts?	2015	journal of informetrics	10.1016/j.joi.2015.01.006	evaluative bibliometrics compare the citation impact of researchers, research groups and institutions with each other across time scales and disciplines. both factors, discipline and period - have an influence on the citation count which is independent of the quality of the publication. normalizing the citation impact of papers for these two factors started in the mid-1980s. since then, a range of different methods have been presented for producing normalized citation impact scores. the current study uses a data set of over 50,000 records to test which of the methods so far presented correlate better with the assessment of papers by peers. the peer assessments come from f1000prime - a post-publication peer review system of the biomedical literature. of the normalized indicators, the current study involves not only cited-side indicators, such as the mean normalized citation score, but also citing-side indicators. as the results show, the correlations of the indicators with the peer assessments all turn out to be very similar. since f1000 focuses on biomedicine, it is important that the results of this study are validated by other studies based on datasets from other disciplines or (ideally) based on multi-disciplinary datasets.

mcburney m.k.; novak p.l.	what is bibliometrics and why should you care?	2002	ipcc 2002, reflections on communication, proceedings		viewed in the aggregate, a company's publications represent one of its greatest business assets. can professionals in the information and communication fields help their company understand the return on its investment in publishing? the field of bibliometrics studies publication patterns by using quantitative analysis and statistics. bibliometrics can be either descriptive, such as looking at how many articles your organization has published, or evaluative, such as using citation analysis to look at how those articles influenced subsequent research by others. counting publications can be useful for doing some comparisons, but citation analysis allows you to look at the impact those articles have had on others by determining how often they are cited. citation analysis can also show what journals, organizations, and even countries have high impact in different fields of research. the institute for scientific information (isi) has been a leader in the citation analysis field since 1961, when isi published the first science citation index. pacific northwest national laboratory (pnnl) has been using data from isi for both descriptive and evaluative purposes. this data is used to track what the researchers at the laboratory are writing and then comparing research groups within the organization over a period of years to identify trends and opportunities. pnnl has also used citation analysis to explore what organizations and academic institutions are doing research in certain fields for partnering opportunities.	bibliometrics; citation analysis; impact factor

maflahi n.; thelwall m.	when are readership counts as useful as citation counts? scopus versus mendeley for lis journals	2016	journal of the association for information science and technology	10.1002/asi.23369	in theory, articles can attract readers on the social reference sharing site mendeley before they can attract citations, so mendeley altmetrics could provide early indications of article impact. this article investigates the influence of time on the number of mendeley readers of an article through a theoretical discussion and an investigation into the relationship between counts of readers of, and citations to, 4 general library and information science (lis) journals. for this discipline, it takes about 7 years for articles to attract as many scopus citations as mendeley readers, and after this the spearman correlation between readers and citers is stable at about 0.6 for all years. this suggests that mendeley readership counts may be useful impact indicators for both newer and older articles. the lack of dates for individual mendeley article readers and an unknown bias toward more recent articles mean that readership data should be normalized individually by year, however, before making any comparisons between articles published in different years.	bibliometrics

leydesdorff l.; bornmann l.	the operationalization of fields as wos subject categories (wcs) in evaluative bibliometrics: the cases of library and information science and science & technology studies	2016	journal of the association for information science and technology	10.1002/asi.23408	normalization of citation scores using reference sets based on web of science subject categories (wcs) has become an established (best) practice in evaluative bibliometrics. for example, the times higher education world university rankings are, among other things, based on this operationalization. however, wcs were developed decades ago for the purpose of information retrieval and evolved incrementally with the database; the classification is machine-based and partially manually corrected. using the wc information science & library science and the wcs attributed to journals in the field of science and technology studies, we show that wcs do not provide sufficient analytical clarity to carry bibliometric normalization in evaluation practices because of indexer effects. can the compliance with best practices be replaced with an ambition to develop best possible practices? new research questions can then be envisaged.	classification
rushforth a.; de rijcke s.	accounting for impact? the journal impact factor and the making of biomedical research in the netherlands	2015	minerva	10.1007/s11024-015-9274-5	the range and types of performance metrics has recently proliferated in academic settings, with bibliometric indicators being particularly visible examples. one field that has traditionally been hospitable towards such indicators is biomedicine. here the relative merits of bibliometrics are widely discussed, with debates often portraying them as heroes or villains. despite a plethora of controversies, one of the most widely used indicators in this field is said to be the journal impact factor (jif). in this article we argue that much of the current debates around researchers' uses of the jif in biomedicine can be classed as 'folk theories': explanatory accounts told among a community that seldom (if ever) get systematically checked. such accounts rarely disclose how knowledge production itself becomes more-or-less consolidated around the jif. using ethnographic materials from different research sites in dutch university medical centers, this article sheds new empirical and theoretical light on how performance metrics variously shape biomedical research on the 'shop floor.' our detailed analysis underscores a need for further research into the constitutive effects of evaluative metrics.	journal impact factor; biomedicine; performance indicators; bibliometrics; research evaluation

guan j.c.; ma n.	a comparative study of research performance in computer science	2004	scientometrics	10.1023/b:scie.0000045114.85737.1b	the paper compares the research performance in computer science of four major western countries, india and china, based on the data abstracted from inspec database during the period 1993-2002. a total of 9,632 computer science papers recorded in inspec database were used for the comparison. the findings indicate that, on the one hand, the number of papers produced in china has considerably increased in the past few years. particularly, in recent years, china occupies a remarkable high position in terms of counts of papers indexed by the inspec database. on the other hand, chinese scientists preferred to publish in domestic journals and proceedings and shares of sci-papers to the total journal papers for china have still remained the lowest. this indicates that the research activities of chinese scientists in computer science are still rather local and suffer from a low international visibility. various scientometric indicators, such as normalized impact factor, ratio of papers in high quality journals are further adopted to analyze research performance and diverse finding are obtained. nevertheless, for these surrogate indicators, china has optimistically achieved great progress, characterized with low level of beginning and high speed of developing. the policy implication of the findings lies in that china, as well as other less developed countries in science, can earn relative competitive advantages in some new emerging or younger disciplines such as computer science by properly using catch-up strategy.

friege j.; chappin e.	modelling decisions on energy-efficient renovations: a review	2014	renewable & sustainable energy reviews	10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.091	the buildings sector accounts for more than 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions. despite the well-known economic viability of many energy-efficient renovation measures which offer great potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting climate protection targets, there is a relatively low level of implementation. we performed a citation network analysis in order to identify papers at the research front and intellectual base on energy-efficient renovation in four areas: technical options, understanding decisions, incentive instruments, and models and simulation. the literature was reviewed in order to understand what is needed to sufficiently increase the number of domestic energy-efficient renovations and to identify potential research gaps. our findings show that the literature on energy-efficient renovation gained considerable momentum in the last decade, but lacks a deep understanding of the uncertainties surrounding economic aspects and non-economic factors driving renovation decisions of homeowners. the analysis indicates that the (socio-economic) energy saving potential and profitability of energy-efficient renovation measures is lower than generally expected. it is suggested that this can be accounted for by the failure to understand and consider the underpinning influences of energy-consuming behaviour in calculations. homeowners' decisions to renovate are shaped by an alliance of economic and non-economic goals. therefore, existing incentives, typically targeting the economic viability of measures, have brought little success. a deeper understanding of the decisions of homeowners is needed and we suggest that a simulation model which maps the decision-making processes of homeowners may result in refining existing instruments or developing new innovative mechanisms to tackle the situation.

confraria h.; godinho m.m.	the impact of african science: a bibliometric analysis	2015	scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-014-1463-8	the number of scientific papers published by researchers in africa has been rising faster than the total world scientific output in recent years. this trend is relevant, as for a long period up until 1996, africa's share of the world scientific output remained below 1.5 %. the propensity to publish in the continent has risen particularly fast since 2004, suggesting that a possible take-off of african science is taking place. this paper highlights that, in parallel with this most recent growth in output, the apparent productivity of african science, as measured by publications to gross domestic product, has risen in recent years to a level above the world average, although, when one looks at the equivalent ratio after it has been normalized by population, there is still a huge gap to overcome. further it is shown that publications from those few african countries whose scientific communities demonstrate higher levels of specialization and integration in international networks, have a higher impact than the world average. additionally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the new knowledge that has been produced by african researchers, highlighting that so far, south africa seems to be the only african country where a reasonable part of that new knowledge seems to be connecting with innovation.	africa; science; research policy; bibliometrics; research assessment; scientific impact

chang j.; desai n.; gosain a.	correlation between altmetric score and citations in pediatric surgery core journals	2019	journal of surgical research	10.1016/j.jss.2019.05.010	background: the impact of a scientific article has traditionally been measured by the impact factor (if) of the journal it is published in and the number of times it is cited. however, citations have a lag period before the true impact of an article can be determined. the altmetric score has emerged as a measure of the digital dissemination of a scientific article across multiple platforms, including tweets, facebook likes, and other social and popular media mentions. we hypothesized that altmetric score would correlate with citations and journal if in pediatric surgery. methods: using the previously identified 14 core journals of pediatric surgery, the top ten most-cited articles from each of these journals were identified for the year 2012, allowing for 5+ y of follow-up. for each article, we determined the number of times cited and the altmetric score. for each journal, the 2012 if and year in which the journal's twitter account was established were determined. bibliometric data were collected for the year 2015 to allow comparison of altmetric scores across years. descriptive statistics and pearson's correlation coefficients were determined using the graphpad prism software. results: citation information for n = 140 articles from 2012 to 2015 was obtained. in 2012, articles were cited 56,159 times (median 192, range 21-5029), and the median altmetric score was 8 (range 0-4261). citations correlated strongly with journal if (r = 0.82, p < 0.0001). altmetric scores in 2012 showed weak positive correlation with citations (r = 0.1895, p = 0.0125) but did not correlate with if (r = 0.0841, p = 0.1617). altmetric scores in 2015 also showed weak positive correlation with citations (r = 0.238, p = 0.0023) but additionally weakly correlated with if (r = 0.2027, p = 0.0082). increasing age of a journal's twitter account resulted in increasing correlation between altmetric score and citations in both 2012 (r = 0.299, p = 0.169) and 2015 (r = 0.512, p = 0.037). twitter was the primary social media contributor to altmetric score in 2012 and 2015, with decreasing contribution from facebook. conclusions: this study is the first to link traditional bibliometric measures with newer measures of digital dissemination for publications in pediatric surgery. although the altmetric score of the top cited articles did not correlate with journal if, it did weakly correlate with citations. interestingly, this correlation was strongest for journals with wellestablished twitter accounts, indicating that, over time, the altmetric score may emerge as a tool to predict future citations. currently, altmetric and traditional bibliometric measures appear to have distinct but complementary roles in measuring dissemination and impact of scientific articles in pediatric surgery.

gorraiz j.; purnell p.j.; glanzel w.	opportunities for and limitations of the book citation index	2013	journal of the american society for information science and technology	10.1002/asi.22875	this article offers important background information about a new product, the book citation index (bkci), launched in 2011 by thomson reuters. information is illustrated by some new facts concerning the bkci's use in bibliometrics, coverage analysis, and a series of idiosyncrasies worthy of further discussion. the bkci was launched primarily to assist researchers identify useful and relevant research that was previously invisible to them, owing to the lack of significant book content in citation indexes such as the web of science. so far, the content of 33,000 books has been added to the desktops of the global research community, the majority in the arts, humanities, and social sciences fields. initial analyses of the data from the bkci have indicated that the bkci, in its current version, should not be used for bibliometric or evaluative purposes. the most significant limitations to this potential application are the high share of publications without address information, the inflation of publication counts, the lack of cumulative citation counts from different hierarchical levels, and inconsistency in citation counts between the cited reference search and the book citation index. however, the bkci is a first step toward creating a reliable and necessary citation data source for monographs- a very challenging issue, because, unlike journals and conference proceedings, books have specific requirements, and several problems emerge not only in the context of subject classification, but also in their role as cited publications and in citing publications.	citation analysis; bibliometrics; databases
kaur j.; radicchi f.; menczer f.	universality of scholarly impact metrics	2013	journal of informetrics	10.1016/j.joi.2013.09.002	given the growing use of impact metrics in the evaluation of scholars, journals, academic institutions, and even countries, there is a critical need for means to compare scientific impact across disciplinary boundaries. unfortunately, citation-based metrics are strongly biased by diverse field sizes and publication and citation practices. as a result, we have witnessed an explosion in the number of newly proposed metrics that claim to be universal. however, there is currently no way to objectively assess whether a normalized metric can actually compensate for disciplinary bias. we introduce a new method to assess the universality of any scholarly impact metric, and apply it to evaluate a number of established metrics. we also define a very simple new metric h(s), which proves to be universal, thus allowing to compare the impact of scholars across scientific disciplines. these results move us closer to a formal methodology in the measure of scholarly impact. published by elsevier ltd.	impact metrics; discipline bias; universality; bibliometrics

romero l.; portillo-salido e.	trends in sigma-1 receptor research: a 25-year bibliometric analysis	2019	frontiers in pharmacology	10.3389/fphar.2019.00564	purpose: there are previous reviews focused on sigma-1 receptor but no bibliometric studies examining this field as a whole. this article aims to present a global view of sigma-1 receptor research and its intellectual structure. methods: we used bibliometric indicators of a basic nature as well as techniques for the visualization and analysis of networks of scientific information extracted from scopus database. results: in total, 1,102 articles from 1992 to 2017 were identified. the growth in the production of articles is not constant over time, with periods of stagnation of approximately 5 years. only 247 authors have five or more publications. the authors appear grouped in relatively independent clusters, thus suggesting a low level of collaborations between those dedicated to the sigma-1 receptor. the united states was the country with the highest production followed by japan and germany. spain, japan, and italy showed the highest per million inhabitants ratio. the highest citation/article ratio was reached in france, united states, and canada. the leading institutions were the university of munster, the national institutes of health, esteve, and inserm. the top authors in number of publications were wunsch-b, schepmann-d, and mauricet. hayashi-t, su-tp and bowen-wd showed the highest citations per article. the article by hayashi-t and su-tp in cell (2007) describing the sigma-1 receptor as a chaperone protein is the top cited reference. cluster labeling from author co-citation analysis shows that research has been focused on specific diseases such as addiction, neuroprotection and neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and pain. high-frequency terms in author keywords suggest that the research efforts in some areas such as neuroimaging, cocaine addiction or psychiatric disorders have declined over time, while others such as neurodegenerative diseases or pain are currently most popular. perspective: a greater involvement of the scientific community, with an increase in the scientific production related to sigma-1, is desirable. additional boost needed to improve research performance is likely to come from combining data from different laboratories to overcome the limitations of individual approaches. the resulting maps are a useful and attractive tool for the sigma-1 receptor research community, as they reveal the main lines of exploration at a glance.	sigma-1 receptor; bibliometrics; scopus; vosviewer; co-occurrence analysis; co-citation analysis; co-authorship analysis

usman m.; ho y.s.	a bibliometric study of the fenton oxidation for soil and water remediation	2020	journal of environmental management	10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110886	fenton based treatments have received tremendous attention in the recent decades as viable strategies for soil and water remediation. there exist different processes associated to the fenton oxidation. efficiency, reaction chemistry, and environmental consequences of these processes vary according to the iron (fe) activation techniques such as soluble fe(ii) (homogeneous fenton process), soluble fe(ii) and chelating agent (modified-fenton), fe minerals or solids (heterogeneous fenton), iron and uv light (photo-fenton) and electro-fenton oxidation. despite immense amount of research articles and reviews related to the fenton oxidation, no bibliometric study of this topic has been published to our knowledge. bibliometric studies provide a useful means to track research output and scholarly trends in a field. here, we conducted a bibliometric study of the publications on this theme (>4000 documents) published during the past three decades available from the science citation index expanded (sci-expanded) database of the web of science core collection (clarivate analytics). based on the bibliometric analysis of 4349 documents, various essential research indicators were described such as the type and language of publications, the most prominent authors in this theme, the most impactful articles, research categories, journals, institutions, and the countries, that have made the greatest contribution to this theme along with potential research hotspots. this bibliometric study allowed visualization of the current landscape and future trends in this field to facilitate the future collaborative research and exchange of knowledge.	bibliometrics; advanced oxidation processes; fenton oxidation; soil remediation; water treatment; wastewater treatment
chanchetti l.f.; leiva d.r.; de faria l.i.l.; ishikawa t.t.	a scientometric review of research in hydrogen storage materials	2020	international journal of hydrogen energy	10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.093	hydrogen is a promising sustainable energy carrier for the future due to its high energetic content and no emissions, other than water vapor. however, its full deployment still requires technological advances in the renewable and cost-effective production of hydrogen, cost reduction of fuel cells and especially in the storage of hydrogen.in a lightweight, compact and safe manner. one way to achieve this is by using materials in which hydrogen bonds chemically, or by adsorption. different kinds of hydrogen storage materials have been investigated, such as metal-organic frameworks (mofs), simple hydrides (including magnesium hydride, mgh2), abs alloys, ab(2) alloys, carbon nanotubes, graphene, borohydrides, alanates and ammonia borane. billions have been invested in storage materials research, resulting in tens of thousands of papers. thus, it is challenging to track how much effort has been devoted to each materials class, by which countries, and how the field has evolved over the years. quantitative science and technology indicators, produced by applying bibliometrics and text mining to scientific papers, can aid in achieving this task. in this work, we evaluated the evolution and distribution of hydrogen storage materials research using this methodology. papers in the 2000-2015 period were collected from web of science and processed in vantagepoint (r) bibliometric software. a thesaurus was elaborated relating keywords and short phrases to specific hydrogen storage materials classes. the number of publications in hydrogen storage materials grew markedly from 2003 to 2010, reducing the pace of growth afterwards until a plateau was reached in 2015. the most researched materials were mofs, simple hydrides and carbon-based materials. there were three typical trends in materials classes: emerging materials, developed after 2003, such as mofs and borohydrides; classical materials with continuous growth during the entire period, such as simple hydrides; and stagnant or declining materials, such as carbon nanotubes and ab(5) alloys. the main publishing countries were china, countries from the european union (eu) and the usa, followed by japan. there is a division between countries with continued growth in recent years, such as china, and those with stagnant production after 2010, such as the eu, the usa and japan. the results of this work, compared to a previous study in storage materials patenting by our group, and the recent launch of commercial hydrogen cars and trains and stationary hydrogen production and fuel cell solutions, indicates that although the hydrogen energy field as a whole is transitioning from lab and prototype stages to commercial deployment, materials-based hydrogen storage still has base technological challenges to be overcome, and therefore still needs more scientific research before large scale commercialization can be realized. the developed thesaurus is made available for refinement and future works.

nielsen m.w.	gender inequality and research performance: moving beyond individual-meritocratic explanations of academic advancement	2016	studies in higher education	10.1080/03075079.2015.1007945	academic debates addressing the persistent gender gap in science reveal considerable contestation of the relevance and extent of the problem. particular attention has been given to the question of whether women's high attrition rates should be ascribed to the structural and cultural barriers inherent to the academic system or instead individualistic matters, such as personal motivation, performance and merit. in order to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of this particular issue, this cross-sectional bibliometric study investigates the link between gender and research performance in the danish context. more specifically, it compares the citation and self-citation rates, source normalized impact per publication scores and collaborative patterns of 3293 male and female researchers at a danish university and provides evidence challenging the widespread assumption of a persistent performance gap in favour of male researchers. the result has implications for research organizations and managers, as it raises concerns about the validity of individual-meritocratic explanations of the skewed gender distributions in academia.	perceptions of inequality; meritocracy; women in science; bibliometrics; citation analysis; scientific performance

franceschet m.; costantini a.	the first italian research assessment exercise: a bibliometric perspective	2011	journal of informetrics	10.1016/j.joi.2010.12.002	in december 2003, seventeen years after the first uk research assessment exercise, italy started up its first-ever national research evaluation, with the aim to evaluate, using the peer review method, the excellence of the national research production. the evaluation involved 20 disciplinary areas, 102 research structures, 18,500 research products and 6661 peer reviewers (1465 from abroad); it had a direct cost of 3.55 millions euros and a time length spanning over 18 months. the introduction of ratings based on ex post quality of output and not on ex ante respect for parameters and compliance is an important leap forward of the national research evaluation system toward meritocracy. from the bibliometric perspective, the national assessment offered the unprecedented opportunity to perform a large-scale comparison of peer review and bibliometric indicators for an important share of the italian research production. the present investigation takes full advantage of this opportunity to test whether peer review judgements and (article and journal) bibliometric indicators are independent variables and, in the negative case, to measure the sign and strength of the association. outcomes allow us to advocate the use of bibliometric evaluation, suitably integrated with expert review, for the forthcoming national assessment exercises, with the goal of shifting from the assessment of research excellence to the evaluation of average research performance without significant increase of expenses.

moed h.f.; luwei m.; nederhof a.j.	towards research performance in the humanities	2002	library trends		this paper describes a general methodology for developing bibliometric performance indicators. such a description provides a framework or paradigm for application-oriented research in the field of evaluative quantitative science and technology studies, particularly in the humanities and social sciences. it is based on our study of scholarly output in the field of law at the four major universities in flanders, the dutch speaking part of belgium. the study illustrates that bibliometrics is much more than conducting citation analyses based on the indexes produced by the institute for scientific information (isi), since citation data do not play a role in the study. interaction with scholars in the fields under consideration and openness in the presentation of the quantitative outcomes are the basic features of the methodology. bibliometrics should be used as air instrument to create a mirror. while not a direct reflection, this study provides a thorough analysis of how scholars in the humanities and social sciences structure their activities and their research output. this structure can be examined empirically from the point of view of its consistency and the degree of consensus among scholars. relevant issues can be raised that are worth considering in more detail in followup studies, and conclusions from our empirical materials may illuminate such issues. we argue that the principal aim of the development and application of bibliometric indicators is to stimulate a debate among scholars in the field under investigation on the nature of scholarly quality, its principal dimensions, and operationalizations. this aim provides a criterion of productivity of the development process. we further contend that librarians are not infrequently requested to provide assistance in collecting data related to research performance assessments, and that the methodology described in the paper aims at offering a general framework for such activities, and can be used by librarians as a line of action whenever they become involved.

(2) international collaboration between china and the united states in this field has gradually increased, and scientific research collaboration between the two countries has increased under the influence of geopolitical conflicts, and collaboration has shown the characteristics of lasting stability. (3) china and the united states exhibit divergent international collaboration patterns, with pakistan being china's foremost partner in this domain, while china serves as the us' primary collaborator. furthermore, china demonstrates a significantly higher volume of independently published works compared with the united states, highlighting the strengthening of china's scientific research capabilities. the number of countries collaborating internationally with china shows a different upward trend than in the united states across the three data sets set in this paper. (4) in the field of ekc hot research, china and the united states have maintained good international partnerships with other countries, and are the preferred countries for scientific research collaboration in other countries in the world. it can be seen from this that international scientific research collaboration for sustainable development represented by the ekc has shown relative stability, and geopolitical changes have not had a significant impact on international collaborative research for sustainable development.	bibliometrics; data visualization; ekc hypothesis; environmental kuznets curve; international collaboration

durisin b.; puzone f.	maturation of corporate governance research, 1993-2007: an assessment	2009	corporate governance-an international review	10.1111/j.1467-8683.2009.00739.x	review this study seeks to investigate whether governance research in fact is a discipline or whether it is rather the subject of multi-disciplinary research. we map the intellectual structure of corporate governance research and its evolution from 1993-2007. based on the analysis of more than 1,000 publications and 48,000 citations in corporate goverance: an international review (cgir) and other academic journals, our study identifies the most influential works, the dominant subfields, and their evolution. our study assesses the maturation of corporate governance research as a discipline; it finds increasing sophistication, depth and rigor, and consistency in its intellectual structure. there is a large body of accumulated corporate governance research in the us, yet there is an empirical gap on cross-national studies in the literature. furthermore, hardly any of the top cited works undertake their study in a cross-national setting. thus, corporate governance research and cgir in its quest to contribute to a global theory of corporate governance might benefit if articles have a cross-national methodological approach and empirical grounding in their research design and if articles explicitly aim at stating the theoretical underpinnings they draw on. globalists find in cgir an outlet addressing economics and finance (e.g., whether and how compensation or dismissal of ceos is related to board characteristics), management (e.g., whether and how best practice codes adoption is related to board characteristics and performance), and accounting (e.g., whether and how earnings manipulations is related to board characteristics) issues globally.	corporate governance; journal influence; co-citation analysis; bibliometrics

thelwall m.; haustein s.; lariviere v.; sugimoto c.r.	do altmetrics work? twitter and ten other social web services	2013	plos one	10.1371/journal.pone.0064841	altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and usefulness. nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. to fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with web of science citations for 76 to 208,739 pubmed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. it also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (twitter, facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for google+ posts. evidence was insufficient for linkedin, pinterest, question and answer sites, and reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.

park k.	controlled drug delivery systems: past forward and future back	2014	journal of controlled release	10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.03.054	controlled drug delivery technology has progressed over the last six decades. this progression began in 1952 with the introduction of the first sustained release formulation. the 1st generation of drug delivery (1950-1980) focused on developing oral and transdermal sustained release systems and establishing controlled drug release mechanisms. the 2nd generation (1980-2010) was dedicated to the development of zero-order release systems, self-regulated drug delivery systems, long-term depot formulations, and nanotechnology-based delivery systems. the latter part of the 2nd generation was largely focused on studying nanoparticle formulations. the journal of controlled release (jcr) has played a pivotal role in the 2nd generation of drug delivery technologies, and it will continue playing a leading role in the next generation. the best path towards a productive 3rd generation of drug delivery technology requires an honest, open dialog without any preconceived ideas of the past. the drug delivery field needs to take a bold approach to designing future drug delivery formulations primarily based on today's necessities, to produce the necessary innovations. the jcr provides a forum for sharing the new ideas that will shape the 3rd generation of drug delivery technology.

kleinberg jon m.	authoritative sources in a hyperlinked environment	1998	proceedings of the annual acm-siam symposium on discrete algorithms		the link structure of a hypermedia environment can be a rich source of information about the content of the environment, provided we have effective means for understanding it. versions of this principle have been studied in the hypertext research community and (in a context predating hypermedia) through journal citation analysis in the field of bibliometrics. in this work we develop a set of algorithmic techniques for studying the link structure of hypermedia environments, and we report on experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in several contexts on the world wide web. one issue that our methods address is that of identifying www pages that are `authoritative sources' on broad search topics; this problem arises, for example, when trying to select a high-quality set of relevant `representative pages' from among a large collection of pages retrieved by a text-based search method. we propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on a method for locating dense bipartite communities in the link structure. our formulation has an interesting interpretation in terms of the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; this motivates additional heuristics for clustering and for computing a type of link-based similarity among hyperlinked documents.	
morton l.m.; cahill j.; hartge p.	reporting participation in epidemiologic studies: a survey of practice	2006	american journal of epidemiology	10.1093/aje/kwj036	self-selection bias may threaten the internal validity of epidemiologic studies. studies with a low level of participation are particularly vulnerable to this bias, and commentators note apparent declines in participation in recent years. the authors therefore conducted a retrospective review to survey the practice of reporting participation in epidemiologic studies, to assess changes in participation over time, and to evaluate the impact of increased biologic specimen collection on participation. the authors abstracted selected study characteristics from 355 peer-reviewed, original, analytic-epidemiology research articles published from january 1 to april 30, 2003, in 10 high-impact general epidemiology, public health, and medical journals. at least some information regarding participation was provided in 59% of cross-sectional studies, 44% of case-control studies, and 32% of cohort studies. participation appears to have declined during 1970-2003 for all study designs. participation declined most steeply for controls in population-based, case-control studies (-1.86% per year, 95% confidence interval: -3.03, -0.69), with steeper declines after 1990. proportionately more studies collected biologic specimens over time, particularly for cohort and case-control study designs (ptrend = 0.06 and 0.03, respectively), yet participation was reported separately for the biologic specimen study component in only 27% of studies. the authors conclude that epidemiologists need to address declining participation and to report participation consistently, including for biologic specimen collection. copyright (c) 2005 by the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health. all rights reserved.	blood specimen collection; case-control studies; cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; epidemiologic methods; patient participation

price d.d.s.	a general theory of bibliometric and other cumulative advantage processes	1976	journal of the american society for information science	10.1002/asi.4630270505	a cumulative advantage distribution is proposed which models statistically the situation in which success breeds success. it differs from the negative binomial distribution in that lack of success, being a non-event, is not punished by increased chance of failure. it is shown that such a stochastic law is governed by the beta function, containing only one free parameter, and this is approximated by a skew or hyperbolic distribution of the type that is widespread in bibliometrics and diverse social science phenomena. in particular, this is shown to be an appropriate underlying probabilistic theory for the bradford law, the lotka law, the pareto and zipf distributions, and for all the empirical results of citation frequency analysis. as side results one may derive also the obsolescence factor for literature use. the beta function is peculiarly elegant for these manifold purposes because it yields both the actual and the cumulative distributions in simple form, and contains a limiting case of an inverse square law to which many empirical distributions conform. copyright (c) 1976 wiley periodicals, inc., a wiley company

holman l.; stuart-fox d.; hauser c.e.	the gender gap in science: how long until women are equally represented?	2018	plos biology	10.1371/journal.pbio.2004956	women comprise a minority of the science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (stemm) workforce. quantifying the gender gap may identify fields that will not reach parity without intervention, reveal underappreciated biases, and inform benchmarks for gender balance among conference speakers, editors, and hiring committees. using the pubmed and arxiv databases, we estimated the gender of 36 million authors from >100 countries publishing in >6000 journals, covering most stemm disciplines over the last 15 years, and made a web app allowing easy access to the data (https://lukeholman.github.io/gendergap/). despite recent progress, the gender gap appears likely to persist for generations, particularly in surgery, computer science, physics, and maths. the gap is especially large in authorship positions associated with seniority, and prestigious journals have fewer women authors. additionally, we estimate that men are invited by journals to submit papers at approximately double the rate of women. wealthy countries, notably japan, germany, and switzerland, had fewer women authors than poorer ones. we conclude that the stemm gender gap will not close without further reforms in education, mentoring, and academic publishing.

saha s.; saint s.; christakis d.a.	impact factor: a valid measure of journal quality?	2003	journal of the medical library association		objectives: impact factor, an index based on the frequency with which a journal's articles are cited in scientific publications, is a putative marker of journal quality. however, empiric studies on impact factor's validity as an indicator of quality are lacking. the authors assessed the validity of impact factor as a measure of quality for general medical journals by testing its association with journal quality as rated by clinical practitioners and researchers. methods: we surveyed physicians specializing in internal medicine in the united states, randomly sampled from the american medical association's physician masterfile (practitioner group, n = 113) and from a list of graduates from a national postdoctoral training program in clinical and health services research (research group, n = 151). respondents rated the quality of nine general medical journals, and we assessed the correlation between these ratings and the journals' impact factors. results: the correlation between impact factor and physicians' ratings of journal quality was strong (r2 = 0.82, p = 0.001). the correlation was higher for the research group (r2 = 0.83, p = 0.001) than for the practitioner group (r2 = 0.62, p = 0.01). conclusions: impact factor may be a reasonable indicator of quality for general medical journals.	
austin p.c.	a critical appraisal of propensity-score matching in the medical literature between 1996 and 2003	2008	statistics in medicine	10.1002/sim.3150	propensity-score methods are increasingly being used to reduce the impact of treatment-selection bias in the estimation of treatment effects using observational data. commonly used propensity-score methods include covariate adjustment using the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, and propensity-score matching. empirical and theoretical research has demonstrated that matching on the propensity score eliminates a greater proportion of baseline differences between treated and untreated subjects than does stratification on the propensity score. however, the analysis of propensity-score-matched samples requires statistical methods appropriate for matched-pairs data. we critically evaluated 47 articles that were published between 1996 and 2003 in the medical literature and that employed propensity-score matching. we found that only two of the articles reported the balance of baseline characteristics between treated and untreated subjects in the matched sample and used correct statistical methods to assess the degree of imbalance. thirteen (28 per cent) of the articles explicitly used statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of matched data when estimating the treatment effect and its statistical significance. common errors included using the log-rank test to compare kaplan-meier survival curves in the matched sample, using cox regression, logistic regression, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and wilcoxon rank sum tests in the matched sample, thereby failing to account for the matched nature of the data. we provide guidelines for the analysis and reporting of studies that employ propensity-score matching. copyright (c) 2007 john wiley & sons, ltd.	matching; observational studies; propensity score; systematic review

chen c.; song m.	visualizing a field of research: a methodology of systematic scientometric reviews	2019	plos one	10.1371/journal.pone.0223994	systematic scientometric reviews, empowered by computational and visual analytic approaches, offer opportunities to improve the timeliness, accessibility, and reproducibility of studies of the literature of a field of research. on the other hand, effectively and adequately identifying the most representative body of scholarly publications as the basis of subsequent analyses remains a common bottleneck in the current practice. what can we do to reduce the risk of missing something potentially significant? how can we compare different search strategies in terms of the relevance and specificity of topical areas covered? in this study, we introduce a flexible and generic methodology based on a significant extension of the general conceptual framework of citation indexing for delineating the literature of a research field. the method, through cascading citation expansion, provides a practical connection between studies of science from local and global perspectives. we demonstrate an application of the methodology to the research of literature-based discovery (lbd) and compare five datasets constructed based on three use scenarios and corresponding retrieval strategies, namely a query-based lexical search (one dataset), forward expansions starting from a groundbreaking article of lbd (two datasets), and backward expansions starting from a recently published review article by a prominent expert in lbd (two datasets). we particularly discuss the relevance of areas captured by expansion processes with reference to the query-based scientometric visualization. the method used in this study for comparing bibliometric datasets is applicable to comparative studies of search strategies.

shen c.; bjork b.-c.	'predatory' open access: a longitudinal study of article volumes and market characteristics	2015	bmc medicine	10.1186/s12916-015-0469-2	background: a negative consequence of the rapid growth of scholarly open access publishing funded by article processing charges is the emergence of publishers and journals with highly questionable marketing and peer review practices. these so-called predatory publishers are causing unfounded negative publicity for open access publishing in general. reports about this branch of e-business have so far mainly concentrated on exposing lacking peer review and scandals involving publishers and journals. there is a lack of comprehensive studies about several aspects of this phenomenon, including extent and regional distribution. methods: after an initial scan of all predatory publishers and journals included in the so-called beall's list, a sample of 613 journals was constructed using a stratified sampling method from the total of over 11,000 journals identified. information about the subject field, country of publisher, article processing charge and article volumes published between 2010 and 2014 were manually collected from the journal websites. for a subset of journals, individual articles were sampled in order to study the country affiliation of authors and the publication delays. results: over the studied period, predatory journals have rapidly increased their publication volumes from 53,000 in 2010 to an estimated 420,000 articles in 2014, published by around 8,000 active journals. early on, publishers with more than 100 journals dominated the market, but since 2012 publishers in the 10-99 journal size category have captured the largest market share. the regional distribution of both the publisher's country and authorship is highly skewed, in particular asia and africa contributed three quarters of authors. authors paid an average article processing charge of 178 usd per article for articles typically published within 2 to 3 months of submission. conclusions: despite a total number of journals and publishing volumes comparable to respectable (indexed by the directory of open access journals) open access journals, the problem of predatory open access seems highly contained to just a few countries, where the academic evaluation practices strongly favor international publication, but without further quality checks.

lambert s.d.; loiselle c.g.	health information-seeking behavior	2007	qualitative health research	10.1177/1049732307305199	seeking information about one's health is increasingly documented as a key coping strategy in health-promotive activities and psychosocial adjustment to illness. in this article, the authors critically examine the scientific literature from 1982 to 2006 on the concept of health information-seeking behavior (hisb) to determine its level of maturity and clarify the concept's essential characteristics. a principle-based method of concept analysis provides the framework for exploring the nature of hisb. the authors reviewed approximately 100 published articles and five books reporting on hisb. although hisb is a popular concept used in various contexts, most hisb definitions provide little insight into the concept's specific meanings. the authors describe the concept's characteristics, contributing to a clearer understanding of hisb, and discuss operationalizations, antecedents, and outcomes of hisb. such an analysis of hisb might guide further theorizing on this highly relevant concept and assist health care providers in designing optimal informational interventions.

bruce newbold k.	self-rated health within the canadian immigrant population: risk and the healthy immigrant effect	2005	social science and medicine	10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.06.048	set within the determinants of health framework and drawing upon statistics canada's longitudinal national population health survey, this paper explores the self-assessed health of canada's immigrant population. using both descriptive and multivariate techniques, including logistic regression and survival analysis, the intent is to identify differences in self-assessed health between the immigrant and native-born populations, the factors that contribute to immigrant self-assessed health, and the factors associated with declining self-assessed health status. in each case, the key questions are whether differences in health status exist between the native- and foreign-born. results indicate mixed support for the healthy immigrant effect, with the native- and foreign-born neither more nor less likely to rank their health as fair or poor. however, results from the proportional hazards model indicated that the native-born were at lower risk to transition to poor health.

van nunen k.; li j.; reniers g.; ponnet k.	bibliometric analysis of safety culture research	2018	safety science	10.1016/j.ssci.2017.08.011	the concept of safety culture is characterised by complexity. on the one hand, the concept is challenging content-wise, and on the other hand, is it a multi-dimensional and cross-disciplinary research domain. in this paper, bibliometric analysis has been applied to the field of safety culture to identify fundamental influences and to obtain a structured overview of the characteristics and the developments in this research domain. in total, 1789 publications published between 1900 and 2015 related to safety culture were identified in web of science. the 1789 publications cover 4591 authors, 775 journals, 76 countries or territories, and 1866 institutions. two main research areas can be distinguished in the domain of safety culture: (1) organisational safety culture and (2) health-care and patient safety culture. the latter research area stands in a dominant position in safety culture research nowadays. key publications are from guldenmund (2000) and sexton et al. (2006). furthermore, 'safety science' is the key journal publishing on safety culture research, and the usa, england and china are the countries that dominate the publication production. it can be concluded that there is much collaborative research in the safety culture domain as multi-authored publications make up about three quarters of all publications. also, safety culture research is characterised by a wide variety of research themes and multidisciplinarity. geographical inequality in the publication output is identified as a point of concern. a movement away from technical aspects towards more human aspects could be detected as a noteworthy change in research focus.

(2) why to propose this method and what is it? (3) which integrations that the bwm were focused on and which areas did they apply to? (4) what extensions of this method were investigated? (5) what are the challenges and future research directions regarding this method? in view of the fact that the research on this method is still in infancy, this paper has guiding significance for the later research related to the bwm. from the theoretical point of view, the reasonable value of consistency ratio, the inconsistency improving methods, the uncertain extensions of the bwm and the techniques for solving multi-optimality model in the bwm are good research issues that need to be further investigated in the future. from the perspective of application, the software packages for this method, the various integrations of this method, the wider application areas, and the international cooperation on this method are good topics to consider.

evans j.a.	electronic publication and the narrowing of science and scholarship	2008	science	10.1126/science.1150473	online journals promise to serve more information to more dispersed audiences and are more efficiently searched and recalled. but because they are used differently than print - scientists and scholars tend to search electronically and follow hyperlinks rather than browse or peruse - electronically available journals may portend an ironic change for science. using a database of 34 million articles, their citations (1945 to 2005), and online availability (1998 to 2005), i show that as more journal issues came online, the articles referenced tended to be more recent, fewer journals and articles were cited, and more of those citations were to fewer journals and articles. the forced browsing of print archives may have stretched scientists and scholars to anchor findings deeply into past and present scholarship. searching online is more efficient and following hyperlinks quickly puts researchers in touch with prevailing opinion, but this may accelerate consensus and narrow the range of findings and ideas built upon.	
von elm e.; poglia g.; walder b.; tramer m.r.	different patterns of duplicate publication: an analysis of articles used in systematic reviews	2004	jama	10.1001/jama.291.8.974	context: duplicate publication is publication of an article that overlaps substantially with an article published elsewhere. patterns of duplication are not well understood. objective: to investigate duplication patterns and propose a decision tree for classification. data sources: we searched a comprehensive list of systematic reviews (1989 through august 15, 2002) in anesthesia and analgesia that is accessible on the internet. we selected published full articles of duplicates that had been identified in these systematic reviews. abstracts, letters, or book chapters were excluded. study selection and data: extraction authors of 56 (40%) of 141 systematic reviews acknowledged identification of duplicates. duplication patterns were identified independently by all investigators comparing samples and outcomes of pairs of duplicates and main articles. information on cross-reference, sponsorship, authorship, and publication characteristics was extracted from the articles. data synthesis: the 56 systematic reviews included 1131 main articles (129337 subjects) and excluded 103 duplicates (12589 subjects) that originated from 78 main articles. sixty articles were published twice, 13 three times, 3 four times, and 2 five times. we identified 6 duplication patterns: (1a) identical samples and identical outcomes (21 pairs); (1b) same as 1a but several duplicates assembled (n=16); (2) identical samples and different outcomes (n=24); (3a) increasing sample and identical outcomes (n=11); (3b) decreasing sample and identical outcomes (n=11); (4) different samples and different outcomes (n=20). the prevalence of covert duplicate articles (without a crossreference to the main article) was 5.3% (65/1234). of the duplicates, 34 (33%) were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, and 66 (64%) had authorship that differed partly or completely from the main article. the median journal impact factor was 1.8 (range, 0.1-29.5) for duplicates and 2.0 (range, 0.4-29.5) for main articles (p=.13). the median annual citation rate was 1.7 (range, 0-27) for duplicates and 2.1 (range, 0-31) for main articles (p=.45). the median number of authors was 4 (range, 1-14) for duplicates and 4 (range, 1-15) for corresponding main articles (p=.02). the median delay in publication between main articles and duplicates was 1 year (range, 0-7 years). conclusions: duplication goes beyond simple copying. six distinct duplication patterns were identified after comparing study samples and outcomes of duplicates and corresponding main articles. authorship was an unreliable criterion. duplicates were published in journals with similar impact factors and were cited as frequently as main articles.

bjork b.-c.; solomon d.	open access versus subscription journals: a comparison of scientific impact	2012	bmc medicine	10.1186/1741-7015-10-73	background: in the past few years there has been an ongoing debate as to whether the proliferation of open access (oa) publishing would damage the peer review system and put the quality of scientific journal publishing at risk. our aim was to inform this debate by comparing the scientific impact of oa journals with subscription journals, controlling for journal age, the country of the publisher, discipline and (for oa publishers) their business model.methods: the 2-year impact factors (the average number of citations to the articles in a journal) were used as a proxy for scientific impact. the directory of open access journals (doaj) was used to identify oa journals as well as their business model. journal age and discipline were obtained from the ulrich's periodicals directory. comparisons were performed on the journal level as well as on the article level where the results were weighted by the number of articles published in a journal. a total of 610 oa journals were compared with 7,609 subscription journals using web of science citation data while an overlapping set of 1,327 oa journals were compared with 11,124 subscription journals using scopus data.results: overall, average citation rates, both unweighted and weighted for the number of articles per journal, were about 30% higher for subscription journals. however, after controlling for discipline (medicine and health versus other), age of the journal (three time periods) and the location of the publisher (four largest publishing countries versus other countries) the differences largely disappeared in most subcategories except for journals that had been launched prior to 1996. oa journals that fund publishing with article processing charges (apcs) are on average cited more than other oa journals. in medicine and health, oa journals founded in the last 10 years are receiving about as many citations as subscription journals launched during the same period.conclusions: our results indicate that oa journals indexed in web of science and/or scopus are approaching the same scientific impact and quality as subscription journals, particularly in biomedicine and for journals funded by article processing charges.

zhang c.-t.	the e-index, complementing the h-index for excess citations	2009	plos one	10.1371/journal.pone.0005429	background:the h-index has already been used by major citation databases to evaluate the academic performance of individual scientists. although effective and simple, the h-index suffers from some drawbacks that limit its use in accurately and fairly comparing the scientific output of different researchers. these drawbacks include information loss and low resolution: the former refers to the fact that in addition to h2 citations for papers in the h-core, excess citations are completely ignored, whereas the latter means that it is common for a group of researchers to have an identical h-index.methodology/principal findings:to solve these problems, i here propose the e-index, where e2 represents the ignored excess citations, in addition to the h2 citations for h-core papers. citation information can be completely depicted by using the h-index together with the e-index, which are independent of each other. some other h-type indices, such as a and r, are h-dependent, have information redundancy with h, and therefore, when used together with h, mask the real differences in excess citations of different researchers.conclusions/significance:although simple, the e-index is a necessary h-index complement, especially for evaluating highly cited scientists or for precisely comparing the scientific output of a group of scientists having an identical h-index.

gilson l.; raphaely n.	the terrain of health policy analysis in low and middle income countries: a review of published literature 1994-2007	2008	health policy and planning	10.1093/heapol/czn019	this article provides the first ever review of literature analysing the health policy processes of low and middle income countries (lmics). based on a systematic search of published literature using two leading international databases, the article maps the terrain of work published between 1994 and 2007, in terms of policy topics, lines of inquiry and geographical base, as well as critically evaluating its strengths and weaknesses. the overall objective of the review is to provide a platform for the further development of this field of work.from an initial set of several thousand articles, only 391 were identified as relevant to the focus of inquiry. of these, 164 were selected for detailed review because they present empirical analyses of health policy change processes within lmic settings. examination of these articles clearly shows that lmic health policy analysis is still in its infancy. there are only small numbers of such analyses, whilst the diversity of policy areas, topics and analytical issues that have been addressed across a large number of country settings results in a limited depth of coverage within this body of work. in addition, the majority of articles are largely descriptive in nature, limiting understanding of policy change processes within or across countries. nonetheless, the broad features of experience that can be identified from these articles clearly confirm the importance of integrating concern for politics, process and power into the study of health policy. by generating understanding of the factors influencing the experience and results of policy change, such analysis can inform action to strengthen future policy development and implementation. this article, finally, outlines five key actions needed to strengthen the field of health policy analysis within lmics, including capacity development and efforts to generate systematic and coherent bodies of work underpinned by both the intent to undertake rigorous analytical work and concern to support policy change.

opthof t.	sense and nonsense about the impact factor	1997	cardiovascular research	10.1016/s0008-6363(96)00215-5	the impact factor is based on citations of papers published by a scientific journal. it has been published since 1961 by the institute for scientific information. it may be regarded as an estimate of the citation rate of a journal's papers, and the higher its value, the higher the scientific esteem of the journal. although the impact factor was originally meant for comparison of journals, it is also used for assessment of the quality of individual papers, scientists and departments. for the latter a scientific basis is lacking, as we will demonstrate in this contribution.	citation analysis; impact factor; quality assessment

haustein s.; costas r.; lariviere v.	characterizing social media metrics of scholarly papers: the effect of document properties and collaboration patterns	2015	plos one	10.1371/journal.pone.0120495	a number of new metrics based on social media platforms - grouped under the term altmetrics - have recently been introduced as potential indicators of research impact. despite their current popularity, there is a lack of information regarding the determinants of these metrics. using publication and citation data from 1.3 million papers published in 2012 and covered in thomson reuters' web of science as well as social media counts from altmetric.com, this paper analyses the main patterns of five social media metrics as a function of document characteristics (i.e., discipline, document type, title length, number of pages and references) and collaborative practices and compares them to patterns known for citations. results show that the presence of papers on social media is low, with 21.5% of papers receiving at least one tweet, 4.7% being shared on facebook, 1.9% mentioned on blogs, 0.8% found on google+ and 0.7% discussed in mainstream media. by contrast, 66.8% of papers have received at least one citation. our findings show that both citations and social media metrics increase with the extent of collaboration and the length of the references list. on the other hand, while editorials and news items are seldom cited, it is these types of document that are the most popular on twitter. similarly, while longer papers typically attract more citations, an opposite trend is seen on social media platforms. finally, contrary to what is observed for citations, it is papers in the social sciences and humanities that are the most often found on social media platforms. on the whole, these findings suggest that factors driving social media and citations are different. therefore, social media metrics cannot actually be seen as alternatives to citations; at most, they may function as complements to other type of indicators.

eysenbach g.; kohler c.	what is the prevalence of health-related searches on the world wide web? qualitative and quantitative analysis of search engine queries on the internet.	2003	amia ... annual symposium proceedings / amia symposium. amia symposium		while health information is often said to be the most sought after information on the web, empirical data on the actual frequency of health-related searches on the web are missing. in the present study we aimed to determine the prevalence of health-related searches on the web by analyzing search terms entered by people into popular search engines. we also made some preliminary attempts in qualitatively describing and classifying these searches. occasional difficulties in determining what constitutes a health-related search led us to propose and validate a simple method to automatically classify a search string as health-related. this method is based on determining the proportion of pages on the web containing the search string and the word health, as a proportion of the total number of pages with the search string alone. using human codings as gold standard we plotted a roc curve and determined empirically that if this co-occurance rate is larger than 35%, the search string can be said to be health-related (sensitivity: 85.2%, specificity 80.4%). the results of our human codings of search queries determined that about 4.5% of all searches are health-related. we estimate that globally a minimum of 6.75 million health-related searches are being conducted on the web every day, which is roughly the same number of searches that have been conducted on the nlm medlars system in 1996 in a full year.

thelwall m.; kousha k.	researchgate: disseminating, communicating, and measuring scholarship?	2015	journal of the association for information science and technology	10.1002/asi.23236	researchgate is a social network site for academics to create their own profiles, list their publications, and interact with each other. like academia.edu, it provides a new way for scholars to disseminate their work and hence potentially changes the dynamics of informal scholarly communication. this article assesses whether researchgate usage and publication data broadly reflect existing academic hierarchies and whether individual countries are set to benefit or lose out from the site. the results show that rankings based on researchgate statistics correlate moderately well with other rankings of academic institutions, suggesting that researchgate use broadly reflects the traditional distribution of academic capital. moreover, while brazil, india, and some other countries seem to be disproportionately taking advantage of researchgate, academics in china, south korea, and russia may be missing opportunities to use researchgate to maximize the academic impact of their publications.

dixon-woods m.	writing wrongs? an analysis of published discourses about the use of patient information leaflets	2001	social science and medicine	10.1016/s0277-9536(00)00247-1	much has been written about how to communicate with patients, but there has been little critical scrutiny of this literature. this paper presents an analysis of publications about the use of patient information leaflets. it suggests that two discourses can be distinguished in this literature. the first of these is the larger of the two. it reflects traditional biomedical concerns and it invokes a mechanistic model of communication in which patients are characterised as passive and open to manipulation in the interests of a biomedical agenda. the persistence of the biomedical model in this discourse is contrasted with the second discourse, which is smaller and more recent in origin. this second discourse draws on a political agenda of patient empowerment, and reflects this in its choice of outcomes of interest, its concern with the use of leaflets as a means of democratisation, and its orientation towards patients. it is suggested that the two discourses, though distinct, are not entirely discrete, and may begin to draw closer as they begin to draw on a wider set of resources, including sociological research and theory, to develop a rigorous theoretically grounded approach to patient information leaflets. copyright (c) 2001 elsevier science ltd.	discourse; patient empowerment; patient information

sugimoto c.r.; ahn y.-y.; smith e.; macaluso b.; lariviere v.	factors affecting sex-related reporting in medical research: a cross-disciplinary bibliometric analysis	2019	the lancet	10.1016/s0140-6736(18)32995-7	background: clinical and preclinical studies have shown that there are sex-based differences at the genetic, cellular, biochemical, and physiological levels. despite this, numerous studies have shown poor levels of inclusion of female populations into medical research. these disparities in sex inclusion in research are further complicated by the absence of sufficient reporting and analysis by sex of study populations. disparities in the inclusion of the sexes in medical research substantially reduce the utility of the results of such research for the entire population. the absence of sex-related reporting are problematical for the translation of research from the preclinical to clinical and applied health settings. large-scale studies are needed to identify the extent of sex-related reporting and where disparities are more prevalent. in addition, while several studies have shown the dearth of female researchers in science, few have evaluated whether a scarcity of women in science might be related to disparities in sex inclusion and reporting. we aimed to do a cross-disciplinary analysis of the degree of sex-related reporting across the health sciences--from biomedical, to clinical, and public health research--and the role of author gender in sex-related reporting. methods: this bibliometric analysis analysed sex-related reporting in medical research examining more than 11*5 million papers indexed in web of science and pubmed between 1980 and 2016 and using sex-related medical subject headings as a proxy for sex reporting. for papers that were published between 2008 and 2016 and could be matched with pubmed, we assigned a gender to first and last authors on the basis of their names, according to our gender assignment algorithm. we removed papers for which we could not determine the gender of either the first or last author. we grouped papers into three disciplinary categories (biomedical research, clinical medicine, and public health). we used descriptive statistics and regression analyses (controlling for the number of authors and representation of women in specific diseases, countries, continents, year, and specialty areas) to study associations between the gender of the authors and sex-related reporting. findings: between jan 1, 1980, and dec 31, 2016, sex-related reporting increased from 59% to 67% in clinical medicine and from 36% to 69% in public health research. but for biomedical research, sex remains largely under-reported (31% in 2016). papers with female first and last authors had an increased probability of reporting sex, with an odds ratio of 1*26 (95% ci 1*24 to 1*27), and sex-related reporting was associated with publications in journals with low journal impact factors. for publications in 2016, sex-related reporting of both male and female is associated with a reduction of -0*51 (95% ci -0*54 to -0*47) in journal impact factors. interpretation: gender disparities in the scientific workforce and scarcity of policies on sex-related reporting at the journal and institutional level could inhibit effective research translation from bench to clinical studies. diversification in the scientific workforce and in the research populations--from cell lines, to rodents, to humans--is essential to produce the most rigorous and effective medical research. funding: canada research chairs.

perez-vizcaino f.; fraga c.g.	research trends in flavonoids and health	2018	archives of biochemistry and biophysics	10.1016/j.abb.2018.03.022	herein we describe, based on some bibliometric data, how the field of research on flavonoids has evolved over the last 25 years. the number of papers on flavonoids has risen in an exponential manner over these years, much faster than other fields on food constituents. this increase appears to be related to the contemporary explosion of interest in healthy foods, supplements and nutraceuticals. it was also probably triggered by large epidemiological studies on fruits and vegetables, and particularly on flavonoids, consumption and incidence of cancer, stroke and coronary heart disease. the widely distributed flavonols constitute the flavonoid subgroup upon which the greatest interest has been focused, followed by flavanols and more recently by anthocyanidins and other related polyphenols such as resveratrol. research on isoflavones rapidly emerged in the 1990s but plateaued in the 2000s. in the 1990s flavonoids were mainly considered as the active components of medicinal plants, while from 2000 onward, they switched to be mainly regarded as bioactive food ingredients. we envision a continuation in the growth of research for the coming decade focused on clearly demonstrating the importance of flavonoids for human health.

lin j.; john w.j.	pubmed related articles: a probabilistic topic-based model for content similarity	2007	bmc bioinformatics	10.1186/1471-2105-8-423	background: we present a probabilistic topic-based model for content similarity called pmra that underlies the related article search feature in pubmed. whether or not a document is about a particular topic is computed from term frequencies, modeled as poisson distributions. unlike previous probabilistic retrieval models, we do not attempt to estimate relevance-but rather our focus is relatedness, the probability that a user would want to examine a particular document given known interest in another. we also describe a novel technique for estimating parameters that does not require human relevance judgments; instead, the process is based on the existence of mesh (r) in medline (r). results: the pmra retrieval model was compared against bm25, a competitive probabilistic model that shares theoretical similarities. experiments using the test collection from the trec 2005 genomics track shows a small but statistically significant improvement of pmra over bm25 in terms of precision. conclusion: our experiments suggest that the pmra model provides an effective ranking algorithm for related article search.

skolbekken j.-a.	the risk epidemic in medical journals	1995	social science and medicine	10.1016/0277-9536(94)00262-r	searches in medline databases show a rapid increase in the number of articles with the term 'risk(s)' in the title and/or abstract in the period from 1967 to 1991. this trend is found in medical journals giving a general coverage of medicine and journals covering obstetrics and gynaecology in u.s.a., britain and scandinavia. the most rapid increase is, however, found in epidemiological journals. comparisons of the developments in the occurrence of such terms as risk, hazard, danger and uncertainty show that the increasing frequency of the term risk in the medical literature can not be explained as a change in terminology alone. it is hypothesized that the ongoing trend, which resembles an epidemic, is a result of developments in science and technology, that has changed our beliefs about the locus of control from factors outside human control to factors inside our control. the origins of the epidemic may be traced to the development of such disciplines as probability statistics, increased focus on risk management and health promotion, with recent developments in computer technology as the factor responsible for the escalation seen in the past decade. with the cultural selection of risks in mind, the social construction of risk is discussed. potentially harmful effects of such an epidemic are discussed, exemplified through controversies over current epidemiological risk construction and strategies for coronary risk reduction. it is finally argued that the risk epidemic reflects the social constructions of a particular culture at a particular time in history.

lariviere v.; gingras y.	brief communication: the impact factor's matthew effect: a natural experiment in bibliometrics	2010	journal of the american society for information science and technology		since the publication of robert k. merton's theory of cumulative advantage in science (matthew effect), several empirical studies have tried to measure its presence at the level of papers, individual researchers, institutions, or countries. however, these studies seldom control for the intrinsic quality of papers or of researchers-better (however defined) papers or researchers could receive higher citation rates because they are indeed of better quality. using an original method for controlling the intrinsic value of papers-identical duplicate papers published in different journals with different impact factors-this paper shows that the journal in which papers are published have a strong influence on their citation rates, as duplicate papers published in highimpact journals obtain, on average, twice as many citations as their identical counterparts published in journals with lower impact factors. the intrinsic value of a paper is thus not the only reason a given paper gets cited or not, there is a specific matthew effect attached to journals and this gives to papers published there an added value over and above their intrinsic quality.

wang j.; thijs b.; glanzel w.	interdisciplinarity and impact: distinct effects of variety, balance, and disparity	2015	plos one	10.1371/journal.pone.0127298	interdisciplinary research is increasingly recognized as the solution to today's challenging scientific and societal problems, but the relationship between interdisciplinary research and scientific impact is still unclear. this paper studies the association between the degree of interdisciplinarity and the number of citations at the paper level. different from previous studies compositing various aspects of interdisciplinarity into a single indicator, we use factor analysis to uncover distinct dimensions of interdisciplinarity corresponding to variety, balance, and disparity. we estimate poisson models with journal fixed effects and robust standard errors to analyze the divergent relationships between these three factors and citations. we find that long-term (13-year) citations (1) increase at an increasing rate with variety, (2) decrease with balance, and (3) increase at a decreasing rate with disparity. furthermore, interdisciplinarity also affects the process of citation accumulation: (1) although variety and disparity have positive effects on long-term citations, they have negative effects on short-term (3-year) citations, and (2) although balance has a negative effect on long-term citations, its negative effect is insignificant in the short run. these findings have important implications for interdisciplinary research and science policy.

oldenburg b.f.; sallis j.f.; ffrench m.l.; owen n.	health promotion research and the diffusion and institutionalization of interventions	1999	health education research	10.1093/her/14.1.121	to examine the extent to which health promotion research is providing an empirical basis for the diffusion and institutionalization of effective interventions, we conducted a systematic audit of all articles in 12 public health and health promotion journals for the 1994 calendar year. we identified empirical/non-empirical and health promotion/non-health promotion articles. for each study, the health behaviours or outcomes studied, the target group, gender and setting were categorized. each study was also categorized as belonging to one of four stages: basic research and development, innovation development, diffusion research, and research into institutionalization or policy implementation. of all articles coded (n = 1210), 33.9% were identified as non-research, 39.5% were health promotion research and 26.6% were non-health promotion research. the vast majority of studies fell within the basic research and development stage (89.6%), with less than 1% categorized as diffusion research and only 5% as institutionalization or policy implementation research. the published studies reviewed provide a limited empirical basis for diffusion and institutionalization of health promotion programs. these findings suggest a need to more systematically monitor research input (funding) and research output (publications), and to develop a more explicit focus on the relevance of the stages of research innovation and development, the issues and/or behaviours addressed, the target population, and the research setting.	
li f.; li m.; guan p.; ma s.; cui l.	mapping publication trends and identifying hot spots of research on internet health information seeking behavior: a quantitative and co-word biclustering analysis	2015	journal of medical internet research	10.2196/jmir.3326	background: the internet has become an established source of health information for people seeking health information. in recent years, research on the health information seeking behavior of internet users has become an increasingly important scholarly focus. however, there have been no long-term bibliometric studies to date on internet health information seeking behavior. objective: the purpose of this study was to map publication trends and explore research hot spots of internet health information seeking behavior. methods: a bibliometric analysis based on pubmed was conducted to investigate the publication trends of research on internet health information seeking behavior. for the included publications, the annual publication number, the distribution of countries, authors, languages, journals, and annual distribution of highly frequent major mesh (medical subject headings) terms were determined. furthermore, co-word biclustering analysis of highly frequent major mesh terms was utilized to detect the hot spots in this field. results: a total of 533 publications were included. the research output was gradually increasing. there were five authors who published four or more articles individually. a total of 271 included publications (50.8%) were written by authors from the united states, and 516 of the 533 articles (96.8%) were published in english. the eight most active journals published 34.1% (182/533) of the publications on this topic. ten research hot spots were found: (1) behavior of internet health information seeking about hiv infection or sexually transmitted diseases, (2) internet health information seeking behavior of students, (3) behavior of internet health information seeking via mobile phone and its apps, (4) physicians' utilization of internet medical resources, (5) utilization of social media by parents, (6) internet health information seeking behavior of patients with cancer (mainly breast cancer), (7) trust in or satisfaction with web-based health information by consumers, (8) interaction between internet utilization and physician-patient communication or relationship, (9) preference and computer literacy of people using search engines or other web-based systems, and (10) attitude of people (especially adolescents) when seeking health information via the internet. conclusions: the 10 major research hot spots could provide some hints for researchers when launching new projects. the output of research on internet health information seeking behavior is gradually increasing. compared to the united states, the relatively small number of publications indexed by pubmed from other developed and developing countries indicates to some extent that the field might be still underdeveloped in many countries. more studies on internet health information seeking behavior could give some references for health information providers.

walshe k.	pseudoinnovation: the development and spread of healthcare quality improvement methodologies	2009	international journal for quality in health care	10.1093/intqhc/mzp012	background. over the last two decades, we have seen the successive rise and fall of a number of concepts, ideas or methods in healthcare quality improvement (qi). paradoxically, the content of many of these qi methodologies is very similar, though their presentation often seeks to differentiate or distinguish them. methods. this paper sets out to explore the processes by which new qi methodologies are developed and disseminated and the impact this has on the effectiveness of qi programmes in healthcare organizations. it draws on both a bibliometric analysis of the qi literature over the period from 1988 to 2007 and a review of the literature on the effectiveness of qi programmes and their evaluation. results. the repeated presentation of an essentially similar set of qi ideas and methods under different names and terminologies is a process of 'pseudoinnovation', which may be driven by both the incentives for qi methodology developers and the demands and expectations of those responsible for qi in healthcare organizations. we argue that this process has important disbenefits because qi programmes need sustained and long-term investment and support in order to bring about significant improvements. the repeated redesign of qi programmes may have damaged or limited their effectiveness in many healthcare organizations. conclusions. a more sceptical and scientifically rigorous approach to the development, evaluation and dissemination of qi methodologies is needed, in which a combination of theoretical, empirical and experiential evidence is used to guide and plan their uptake. our expectations of the evidence base for qi methodologies should be on a par with our expectations in relation to other forms of healthcare interventions.

khalsa s.b.s.	yoga as a therapeutic intervention: a bibliometric analysis of published research studies	2004	indian journal of physiology and pharmacology		although yoga is historically a spiritual discipline, it has also been used clinically as a therapeutic intervention. a bibliometric analysis. on the biomedical journal literature involving research on the clinical application of yoga has revealed an increase in publication frequency over the past 3 decades with a substantial and growing use of randomized controlled trials. types of medical conditions have included psychopathological (e.g. depression, anxiety), cardiovascular (e.g. hypertension, heart disease), respiratory (e.g. asthma), diabetes and a variety of others. a majority of this research has been conducted by indian investigators and published in indian journals, particularly yoga specialty journals, although recent trends indicate increasing contributions from investigators in the u.s. and england. yoga therapy is a relatively novel and emerging clinical discipline within the broad category of mind-body medicine, whose growth is consistent with the burgeoning popularity of yoga in the west and the increasing worldwide use of alternative medicine.	asana; bibliometric; meditation; mind-body medicine; pranayama; review; yoga
bland j.m.	cluster randomised trials in the medical literature: two bibliometric surveys	2004	bmc medical research methodology	10.1186/1471-2288-4-21	background: several reviews of published cluster randomised trials have reported that about half did not take clustering into account in the analysis, which was thus incorrect and potentially misleading. in this paper i ask whether cluster randomised trials are increasing in both number and quality of reporting. methods: computer search for papers on cluster randomised trials since 1980, hand search of trial reports published in selected volumes of the british medical journal over 20 years. results: there has been a large increase in the numbers of methodological papers and of trial reports using the term 'cluster random' in recent years, with about equal numbers of each type of paper. the british medical journal contained more such reports than any other journal. in this journal there was a corresponding increase over time in the number of trials where subjects were randomised in clusters. in 2003 all reports showed awareness of the need to allow for clustering in the analysis. in 1993 and before clustering was ignored in most such trials. conclusion: cluster trials are becoming more frequent and reporting is of higher quality. perhaps statistician pressure works.

haustein s.; lariviere v.	the use of bibliometrics for assessing research: possibilities, limitations and adverse effects	2015	incentives and performance: governance of research organizations	10.1007/978-3-319-09785-5_8	researchers are used to being evaluated: publications, hiring, tenure and funding decisions are all based on the evaluation of research. traditionally, this evaluation relied on judgement of peers but, in the light of limited resources and increased bureaucratization of science, peer review is getting more and more replaced or complemented with bibliometric methods. central to the introduction of bibliometrics in research evaluation was the creation of the science citation index (sci) in the 1960s, a citation database initially developed for the retrieval of scientific information. embedded in this database was the impact factor, first used as a tool for the selection of journals to cover in the sci, which then became a synonym for journal quality and academic prestige. over the last 10 years, this indicator became powerful enough to influence researchers' publication patterns in so far as it became one of the most important criteria to select a publication venue. regardless of its many flaws as a journal metric and its inadequacy as a predictor of citations on the paper level, it became the go-to indicator of research quality and was used and misused by authors, editors, publishers and research policy makers alike. the h-index, introduced as an indicator of both output and impact combined in one simple number, has experienced a similar fate, mainly due to simplicity and availability. despite their massive use, these measures are too simple to capture the complexity and multiple dimensions of research output and impact. this chapter provides an overview of bibliometric methods, from the development of citation indexing as a tool for information retrieval to its application in research evaluation, and discusses their misuse and effects on researchers' scholarly communication behavior.

weale a.r.; bailey m.; lear p.a.	the level of non-citation of articles within a journal as a measure of quality: a comparison to the impact factor	2004	bmc medical research methodology	10.1186/1471-2288-4-14	background: current methods of measuring the quality of journals assume that citations of articles within journals are normally distributed. furthermore using journal impact factors to measure the quality of individual articles is flawed if citations are not uniformly spread between articles. the aim of this study was to assess the distribution of citations to articles and use the level of non-citation of articles within a journal as a measure of quality. this ranking method is compared with the impact factor, as calculated by isi(r). methods: total citations gained by october 2003, for every original article and review published in current immunology (13125 articles; 105 journals) and surgical (17083 articles; 120 journals) fields during 2001 were collected using isi(r) web of science. results: the distribution of citation of articles within an individual journal is mainly non-parametric throughout the literature. one sixth (16.7%; iqr 13.6-19.2) of articles in a journal accrue half the total number of citations to that journal. there was a broader distribution of citation to articles in higher impact journals and in the field of immunology compared to surgery. 23.7% (iqr 14.6-42.4) of articles had not yet been cited. levels of non-citation varied between journals and subject fields. there was a significant negative correlation between the proportion of articles never cited and a journal's impact factor for both immunology (rho = -0.854) and surgery journals (rho = -0.924). conclusion: ranking journals by impact factor and non-citation produces similar results. using a non-citation rate is advantageous as it creates a clear distinction between how citation analysis is used to determine the quality of a journal (low level of non-citation) and an individual article (citation counting). non-citation levels should therefore be made available for all journals.

washer p.; joffe h.	the hospital superbug: social representations of mrsa	2006	social science and medicine	10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.05.018	the so-called 'hospital superbug' methcillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) became a topic of media and political concern in britain from the middle of the 1990s. it was increasingly politicised in the period leading up to the british general election of 2005. this study examines the meanings of mrsa that circulate in britain by analysing newspaper coverage of the disease over the 10-year period 1995-2005. it utilises social representations theory and contextualises mrsa within existing research on representations of emerging infectious diseases (eids). a key pattern in the representation of eids is to externalise the threat they pose by linking the origin, risk and blame to 'the other' of those who represent them. it is in this light that this study investigates who and what mrsa is associated with and the impact that these associations have on levels of alarm and blame. key findings are that mrsa is represented as a potentially lethal 'superbug', marking the end of a 'golden age of medicine' in which the story of the discovery of antibiotics has played such a key role. furthermore, mrsa is constructed around an it could be you/me set of assumptions by way of the plethora of human interest stories that dominate the coverage. finally, the blame for mrsa focuses not on its genesis, but rather on why it spreads. this is attributed to poor hygiene in hospitals, which is ultimately caused by mismanagement of the national health service and erosion of the authority and morality symbolised by the 'matron' role. this constellation of meanings informs a somewhat different pattern of response to mrsa when compared to many past eids.

fire m.; guestrin c.	over-optimization of academic publishing metrics: observing goodhart's law in action	2019	gigascience	10.1093/gigascience/giz053	background the academic publishing world is changing significantly, with ever-growing numbers of publications each year and shifting publishing patterns. however, the metrics used to measure academic success, such as the number of publications, citation number, and impact factor, have not changed for decades. moreover, recent studies indicate that these metrics have become targets and follow goodhart's law, according to which, when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. results in this study, we analyzed >120 million papers to examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last century, with a deeper look into the specific field of biology. our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being compromised and their usefulness is lessening. in particular, the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists. measures such as a journal's impact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. moreover, by analyzing properties of >2,600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department. conclusions academic publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure success.

eom y.-h.; fortunato s.	characterizing and modeling citation dynamics	2011	plos one	10.1371/journal.pone.0024926	citation distributions are crucial for the analysis and modeling of the activity of scientists. we investigated bibliometric data of papers published in journals of the american physical society, searching for the type of function which best describes the observed citation distributions. we used the goodness of fit with kolmogorov-smirnov statistics for three classes of functions: log-normal, simple power law and shifted power law. the shifted power law turns out to be the most reliable hypothesis for all citation networks we derived, which correspond to different time spans. we find that citation dynamics is characterized by bursts, usually occurring within a few years since publication of a paper, and the burst size spans several orders of magnitude. we also investigated the microscopic mechanisms for the evolution of citation networks, by proposing a linear preferential attachment with time dependent initial attractiveness. the model successfully reproduces the empirical citation distributions and accounts for the presence of citation bursts as well.

fanelli d.; glanzel w.	bibliometric evidence for a hierarchy of the sciences	2013	plos one	10.1371/journal.pone.0066938	the hypothesis of a hierarchy of the sciences, first formulated in the 19th century, predicts that, moving from simple and general phenomena (e.g. particle dynamics) to complex and particular (e.g. human behaviour), researchers lose ability to reach theoretical and methodological consensus. this hypothesis places each field of research along a continuum of complexity and softness, with profound implications for our understanding of scientific knowledge. today, however, the idea is still unproven and philosophically overlooked, too often confused with simplistic dichotomies that contrast natural and social sciences, or science and the humanities. empirical tests of the hypothesis have usually compared few fields and this, combined with other limitations, makes their results contradictory and inconclusive. we verified whether discipline characteristics reflect a hierarchy, a dichotomy or neither, by sampling nearly 29,000 papers published contemporaneously in 12 disciplines and measuring a set of parameters hypothesised to reflect theoretical and methodological consensus. the biological sciences had in most cases intermediate values between the physical and the social, with bio-molecular disciplines appearing harder than zoology, botany or ecology. in multivariable analyses, most of these parameters were independent predictors of the hierarchy, even when mathematics and the humanities were included. these results support a gradualist view of scientific knowledge, suggesting that the hierarchy of the sciences provides the best rational framework to understand disciplines' diversity. a deeper grasp of the relationship between subject matter's complexity and consensus could have profound implications for how we interpret, publish, popularize and administer scientific research.

peoples b.k.; midway s.r.; sackett d.; lynch a.; cooney p.b.	twitter predicts citation rates of ecological research	2016	plos one	10.1371/journal.pone.0166570	the relationship between traditional metrics of research impact (e.g., number of citations) and alternative metrics (altmetrics) such as twitter activity are of great interest, but remain imprecisely quantified. we used generalized linear mixed modeling to estimate the relative effects of twitter activity, journal impact factor, and time since publication on web of science citation rates of 1,599 primary research articles from 20 ecology journals published from 2012-2014. we found a strong positive relationship between twitter activity (i.e., the number of unique tweets about an article) and number of citations. twitter activity was a more important predictor of citation rates than 5-year journal impact factor. moreover, twitter activity was not driven by journal impact factor; the 'highest-impact' journals were not necessarily the most discussed online. the effect of twitter activity was only about a fifth as strong as time since publication; accounting for this confounding factor was critical for estimating the true effects of twitter use. articles in impactful journals can become heavily cited, but articles in journals with lower impact factors can generate considerable twitter activity and also become heavily cited. authors may benefit from establishing a strong social media presence, but should not expect research to become highly cited solely through social media promotion. our research demonstrates that altmetrics and traditional metrics can be closely related, but not identical. we suggest that both altmetrics and traditional citation rates can be useful metrics of research impact.

alexander haslam s.	making good theory practical: five lessons for an applied social identity approach to challenges of organizational, health, and clinical psychology	2014	british journal of social psychology	10.1111/bjso.12061	social identity research was pioneered as a distinctive theoretical approach to the analysis of intergroup relations but over the last two decades it has increasingly been used to shed light on applied issues. one early application of insights from social identity and self-categorization theories was to the organizational domain (with a particular focus on leadership), but more recently there has been a surge of interest in applications to the realm of health and clinical topics. this article charts the development of this applied social identity approach, and abstracts five core lessons from the research that has taken this forward. (1) groups and social identities matter because they have a critical role to play in organizational and health outcomes. (2) self-categorizations matter because it is people's self-understandings in a given context that shape their psychology and behaviour. (3) the power of groups is unlocked by working with social identities not across or against them. (4) social identities need to be made to matter in deed not just in word. (5) psychological intervention is always political because it always involves some form of social identity management. programmes that seek to incorporate these principles are reviewed and important challenges and opportunities for the future are identified.

sauermann h.; haeussler c.	authorship and contribution disclosures	2017	science advances	10.1126/sciadv.1700404	most scientific research is performed by teams, and for a long time, observers have inferred individual team members' contributions by interpreting author order on published articles. in response to increasing concerns about this approach, journals are adopting policies that require the disclosure of individual authors' contributions. however, it is not clear whether and how these disclosures improve upon the conventional approach. moreover, there is little evidence on how contribution statements are written and how they are used by readers. we begin to address these questions in two studies. guided by a conceptual model, study 1 examines the relationship between author order and contribution statements on more than 12,000 articles to understand what information is provided by each. this analysis quantifies the risk of error when inferring contributions from author order and shows how this risk increases with team size and for certain types of authors. at the same time, the analysis suggests that some components of the value of contributions are reflected in author order but not in currently used contribution statements. complementing the bibliometric analysis, study 2 analyzes survey data from more than 6000 corresponding authors to examine how contribution statements are written and used. this analysis highlights important differences between fields and between senior versus junior scientists, as well as strongly diverging views about the benefits and limitations of contribution statements. on the basis of both studies, we highlight important avenues for future research and consider implications for a broad range of stakeholders. copyright (c) 2017 the authors.

mcburney m.k.; novak p.l.	what is bibliometrics and why should you care?	2002	ieee international professional communication conference		viewed in the aggregate, a company's publications represent one of its greatest business assets. can professionals in the information and communication fields help their company understand the return on its investment in publishing ? the field of bibliometrics studies publication patterns by using quantitative analysis and statistics. bibliometrics can be either descriptive, such as looking at how many articles your organization has published, or evaluative, such as using citation analysis to look at how those articles influenced subsequent research by others. counting publications can be useful for doing some comparisons, but citation analysis allows you to look at the impact those articles have had on others by determining how often they are cited. citation analysis can also show what journals, organizations, and even countries have high impact in different fields of research. the institute for scientific information (isi) has been a leader in the citation analysis field since 1961, when isi published the first science citation index. pacific northwest national laboratory (pnnl) has been using data from isi for both descriptive and evaluative purposes. this data is used to track what the researchers at the laboratory are writing and then comparing research groups within the organization over a period of years to identify trends and opportunities. pnnl has also used citation analysis to explore what organizations and academic institutions are doing research in certain fields for partnering opportunities.	bibliometrics; citation analysis; impact factor
barbic d.; tubman m.; lam h.; barbic s.	an analysis of altmetrics in emergency medicine	2016	academic emergency medicine	10.1111/acem.12898	objectives alternative-level metrics (altmetrics) are a new method to assess the sharing and spread of scientific knowledge. the primary objective of this study was to describe the traditional metrics and altmetric scores of the 50 most frequently cited articles published in emergency medicine (em) journals. since many articles related to em are published in other journals, the secondary aim of this study was to describe the altmetric scores of the most frequently cited articles relevant to em in other biomedical journals. methods a structured search of the institute for scientific information web of science version of the science citation index expanded was conducted. the 200 most frequently cited articles in the top 10 em journals (2011 journal citation report) were identified. the 200 most frequently cited articles from the rest of the medical literature, matching a predefined list of keywords relevant to the specialty of em, were identified. two authors reviewed the lists of citations for relevance to em and a consensus approach was used to arrive at the final lists of the top 50 cited articles. the altmetric scores for the top 50 cited articles in em and other journals were determined. descriptive statistics and spearman correlation were performed. results the highest altmetric score for em articles was 25.0; the mean (+-sd) was 1.9 (+-5.0). the em journal with the highest mean article altmetric score was resuscitation. the main clinical areas shared for articles from em articles were trauma (mean +- sd = 11.0 +- 15.6, median = 11.0) and cardiac arrest (mean +- sd = 2.7 +- 5.8, median = 0). the highest altmetric score for other journals was 176.0 (mean +- sd = 23.3 +- 40.8). the other journal with the highest mean article altmetric score was the new england journal of medicine. the main clinical areas shared for articles were critical care (mean +- sd score = 36.5 +- 47.4, median = 36.5), sepsis (mean +- sd = 24.6 +- 48.8, median = 12.0), cardiology (mean +- sd = 19.2 +- 35.6, median = 7.0), and infectious diseases (mean +- sd = 17.0 +- 12.7, median = 17.0). spearman correlation demonstrated weakly positive correlation between citation counts and altmetric scores for em articles and other journals. conclusions this study is the first analysis of altmetric scores for the top cited articles in em. we demonstrated that there is a mild correlation between citation counts and altmetric scores for the top papers in em and other biomedical journals. we also demonstrated that there is a gap between the sharing of the top articles in em journals and those related to em in other biomedical journals. future research to explore this relationship and its temporal trends will benefit the understanding of the reach and dissemination of em research within the scientific community and society in general.

pierce j.p.; gilpin e.a.	news media coverage of smoking and health is associated with changes in population rates of smoking cessation but not initiation	2001	tobacco control	10.1136/tc.10.2.145	objective - to determine whether changes in news media coverage of smoking and health issues are associated with changes in smoking behaviour in the usa. design and main outcome measures - issue importance in the us news media is assessed by the number of articles published annually in major magazines indexed in the reader's guide to periodical literature. annual incidence rates for cessation and initiation in the usa were computed from the large, representative national health interview surveys (1965-1992). patterns in cessation incidence were considered for ages 20-34 years and 35-50 years. initiation incidence was examined for adolescents (14-17 years) and young adults (18-21 years) of both sexes. results - from 1950 to the early 1980s, the annual incidence of cessation in the usa mirrored the pattern of news media coverage of smoking and health, particularly for middle aged smokers. cessation rates in younger adults increased considerably when secondhand smoke concerns started to increase in the us population. incidence of initiation in young adults did not start to decline until the beginning of the public health campaign against smoking in the 1960s. among adolescents, incidence rates did not start to decline until the 1970s, after the broadcast ban on cigarette advertising. conclusions - the level of coverage of smoking and health in the news media may play an important role in determining the rate of population smoking cessation, but not initiation. in countries where cessation has lagged, advocates should work to increase the newsworthiness of smoking and health issues.	cessation; health; initiation; mass media
zimmermann c.	death denial: obstacle or instrument for palliative care? an analysis of clinical literature	2007	sociology of health and illness	10.1111/j.1467-9566.2007.00495.x	as a society and as individuals, we have come to recognize ourselves as 'death-denying', a self-characterisation particularly prominent in palliative care discourse and practice. as part of a larger project examining death attitudes in the palliative care setting, a medline search (1971 to 2001) was performed combining the text words 'deny' and 'denial' with the subject headings 'terminal care', 'palliative care' and 'hospice care'. the 30 articles were analysed using a constant comparison technique and emerging themes regarding the meaning and usage of the words deny and denial were identified. this paper examines the theme of denial as an obstacle to palliative care. in the articles, denial was described as an impediment to open discussion of dying, dying at home, stopping 'futile' treatments, advance care planning and control of symptoms. i suggest that these components of care together constitute what has come to be perceived as a correct 'way to die'. indeed, the very conceptualisation of denial as an obstacle to these components of care has been integral to building and sustaining the 'way to die' itself. the personal struggle with mortality has become an important instrument in the public problem of managing the dying process.

(2) china had the highest number of publications (n = 1651, 19.66% of global output) and was a core country in the international cooperation network, whereas the united states and european countries produced higher quality papers. (3) by analyzing the co-occurrence and clusters of keywords and comparing three wastewater treatment categories (physical, chemical, biological), adsorption (n = 1277), oxidation (n = 1085) and activated sludge process (n = 1288) were the top three techniques. researchers have shifted their focus to treatment technologies for specific wastewater type, such as textile wastewater, pulp and paper wastewater, and pharmaceutical wastewater. the s-curve from articles indicates that physical and chemical treatment technologies are attached with great potential in the near future, especially adsorption and advanced oxidation, while the biological treatment technologies are approaching to the saturation stage. different pattern is observed for the s-curve derived from patents, which stressed the limited achievement until now and further exploration in the field application for the three treatment categories. our analysis provides information of technology development landscape and future opportunities, which is useful for decision makers and researchers who are interested in this area.

thelwall m.; wilson p.	mendeley readership altmetrics for medical articles: an analysis of 45 fields	2016	journal of the association for information science and technology	10.1002/asi.23501	medical research is highly funded and often expensive and so is particularly important to evaluate effectively. nevertheless, citation counts may accrue too slowly for use in some formal and informal evaluations. it is therefore important to investigate whether alternative metrics could be used as substitutes. this article assesses whether one such altmetric, mendeley readership counts, correlates strongly with citation counts across all medical fields, whether the relationship is stronger if student readers are excluded, and whether they are distributed similarly to citation counts. based on a sample of 332,975 articles from 2009 in 45 medical fields in scopus, citation counts correlated strongly (about 0.7; 78% of articles had at least one reader) with mendeley readership counts (from the new version 1 applications programming interface [api]) in almost all fields, with one minor exception, and the correlations tended to decrease slightly when student readers were excluded. readership followed either a lognormal or a hooked power law distribution, whereas citations always followed a hooked power law, showing that the two may have underlying differences.

campbell p.	escape from the impact factor	2008	ethics in science and environmental politics	10.3354/esep00078	as editor-in-chief of the journal nature, i am concerned by the tendency within academic administrations to focus on a journal's impact factor when judging the worth of scientific contributions by researchers, affecting promotions, recruitment and, in some countries, financial bonuses for each paper. our own internal research demonstrates how a high journal impact factor can be the skewed result of many citations of a few papers rather than the average level of the majority, reducing its value as an objective measure of an individual paper. proposed alternative indices have their own drawbacks. many researchers say that their important work has been published in low-impact journals. focusing on the citations of individual papers is a more reliable indicator of an individual's impact. a positive development is the increasing ability to track the contributions of individuals by means of author-contribution statements and perhaps, in the future, citability of components of papers rather than the whole. there are attempts to escape the hierarchy of high-impact-factor journals by means of undifferentiated databases of peer-reviewed papers such as plos one. it remains to be seen whether that model will help outstanding work to rise to due recognition regardless of editorial selectivity. although the current system may be effective at measuring merit on national and institutional scales, the most effective and fair analysis of a person's contribution derives from a direct assessment of individual papers, regardless of where they were published.

paradis e.; whitehead c.r.	louder than words: power and conflict in interprofessional education articles, 1954-2013	2015	medical education	10.1111/medu.12668	context: interprofessional education (ipe) aspires to enable collaborative practice. current ipe offerings, although rapidly proliferating, lack evidence of efficacy and theoretical grounding. objectives: our research aimed to explore the historical emergence of the field of ipe and to analyse the positioning of this academic field of inquiry. in particular, we sought to investigate the extent to which power and conflict - elements central to interprofessional care - figure in the ipe literature. methods: we used a combination of deductive and inductive automated coding and manual coding to explore the contents of 2191 articles in the ipe literature published between 1954 and 2013. inductive coding focused on the presence and use of the sociological (rather than statistical) version of power, which refers to hierarchies and asymmetries among the professions. articles found to be centrally about power were then analysed using content analysis. results: publications on ipe have grown exponentially in the past decade. deductive coding of identified articles showed an emphasis on students, learning, programmes and practice. automated inductive coding of titles and abstracts identified 129 articles potentially about power, but manual coding found that only six articles put power and conflict at the centre. content analysis of these six articles revealed that two provided tentative explorations of power dynamics, one skirted around this issue, and three explicitly theorised and integrated power and conflict. conclusions: the lack of attention to power and conflict in the ipe literature suggests that many educators do not foreground these issues. education programmes are expected to transform individuals into effective collaborators, without heed to structural, organisational and institutional factors. in so doing, current constructions of ipe veil the problems that ipe attempts to solve.

greninger a.l.	a decade of rna virus metagenomics is (not) enough	2018	virus research	10.1016/j.virusres.2017.10.014	it is hard to overemphasize the role that metagenomics has had on our recent understanding of rna virus diversity. metagenomics in the 21st century has brought with it an explosion in the number of rna virus species, genera, and families far exceeding that following the discovery of the microscope in the 18th century for eukaryotic life or culture media in the 19th century for bacteriology or the 20th century for virology. when the definition of success in organism discovery is measured by sequence diversity and evolutionary distance, rna viruses win. this review explores the history of rna virus metagenomics, reasons for the successes so far in rna virus metagenomics, and methodological concerns. in addition, the review briefly covers clinical metagenomics and environmental metagenomics and highlights some of the critical accomplishments that have defined the fast pace of rna virus discoveries in recent years. slightly more than a decade in, the field is exhausted from its discoveries but knows that there is yet even more out there to be found.

callaham m.l.; tercier j.	the relationship of previous training and experience of journal peer reviewers to subsequent review quality	2007	plos medicine	10.1371/journal.pmed.0040040	background: peer review is considered crucial to the selection and publication of quality science, but very little is known about the previous experiences and training that might identify high-quality peer reviewers. the reviewer selection processes of most journals, and thus the qualifications of their reviewers, are ill defined. more objective selection of peer reviewers might improve the journal peer review process and thus the quality of published science. methods and findings: 306 experienced reviewers (71% of all those associated with a specialty journal) completed a survey of past training and experiences postulated to improve peer review skills. reviewers performed 2,856 reviews of 1,484 separate manuscripts during a four-year study period, all prospectively rated on a standardized quality scale by editors. multivariable analysis revealed that most variables, including academic rank, formal training in critical appraisal or statistics, or status as principal investigator of a grant, failed to predict performance of higher-quality reviews. the only significant predictors of quality were working in a university-operated hospital versus other teaching environment and relative youth (under ten years of experience after finishing training). being on an editorial board and doing formal grant (study section) review were each predictors for only one of our two comparisons. however, the predictive power of all variables was weak. conclusions: our study confirms that there are no easily identifiable types of formal training or experience that predict reviewer performance. skill in scientific peer review may be as ill defined and hard to impart as is common sense. without a better understanding of those skills, it seems unlikely journals and editors will be successful in systematically improving their selection of reviewers. this inability to predict performance makes it imperative that all but the smallest journals implement routine review ratings systems to routinely monitor the quality of their reviews (and thus the quality of the science they publish).
