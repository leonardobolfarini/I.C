Objectives The aim of the study was to analyse the historical perspective of research literature production regarding application of bibliometrics in medicine. Methods Publications related to application of bibliometrics in medicine from 1970 to 2018 were harvested from the Scopus bibliographic database. Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy was triangulated with the VOSViewer to identify historical roots and evolution of topics and clinical areas. Results The search resulted in 6557 publications. The literature production trend was positive. Historical roots analysis identified 33 historical roots and 16 clinical areas where bibliometrics was applied. Discussion The increase in productivity in application of bibliometrics in medicine might be attributed to increased use of quantitative metrics in research evaluation, publish or perish phenomenon and the increased use of evidence-based medicine. Conclusion The trend of the literature production was positive. Medicine was in the forefront of knowledge development in bibliometrics. reference publication year spectroscopy proved to be an accurate method which was able to identify most of the historical roots.","bibliometrics; citation analysis; evidence-based medicine (EBM); research; biomedical"

This was all made possible by the work of Eugene Garfield and his Science Citation Index. This article reviews the distance that bibliometrics has travelled since 1958 by comparing early bibliometrics with current practice, and by giving an overview of a range of recent developments, such as patent analysis, national research evaluation exercises, visualization techniques, new applications, online citation indexes, and the creation of digital libraries. Webometrics, a modern, fast- growing offshoot of bibliometrics, is reviewed in detail.

It connects this context with the contributions of evaluative bibliometrics, emphasising the transition towards a more integrative approach that advocates for a balance between quantitative and qualitative methods in research evaluation. Furthermore, it underscores how the Narrative Curriculum has emerged as one of the fundamental tools in new evaluation processes, as it allows for the description of the complexity and context of academic achievements. Narrative Bibliometrics is proposed, defined as the use of bibliometric indicators to generate stories that support the defence and exposition of a scientific curriculum and/or its individual contributions within the framework of a scientific evaluation process, which demands narratives. To introduce the reader, it presents, in a non-exhaustive manner, sources, indicators, and practical cases for effectively applying Narrative Bibliometrics in various scientific evaluation contexts.

These metrics are grouped into five sets: bibliometrics (publication and citation), usage, participation, rating, social connectivity, and composite indicators. This new bibliometric specialty is necessary because of new trends in scientific assessment, which have moved analysis away from old bibliometrics (based on journal analysis and Impact Factor) towards new bibliometrics that analyze both documents and authors via a mix of indicators.

Over the last ten years we have devoted much of our energy to the development of an analogous research base and infrastructure for patent bibliometrics, that is for the use of patents, and patent citations in the evaluation of technological activities. There are remarkable similarities between literature bibliometrics and patent bibliometrics, and they are both applicable to the same wide ranges of problems. This paper will show that there are striking similarities between literature and patent distributions of national productivity, inventor productivity, referencing cycles, citation impact and within country citation preferences.","N/A"

We here illustrate how scientific workflows and the Taverna workbench in particular can be used in bibliometrics. We discuss the specific capabilities of Taverna that makes this software a powerful tool in this field, such as automated data import via Web services, data extraction from XML by XPaths, and statistical analysis and visualization with R. The support of the latter is particularly relevant, as it allows integration of a number of recently developed R packages specifically for bibliometrics. Examples are used to illustrate the possibilities of Taverna in the fields of bibliometrics and scientometrics.","Bibliometrics; Scientific workflows; Taverna; R; XML; Mass spectrometry; Medicinal chemistry"

Bibliometrics is one of the few subfields concerned with measuring the output side of science. According to most ""histories"", bibliometrics owes its systematic development mainly to D.J.D. Price and Eugene Garfield, as founders. The few works conducted before the 1950s are usually relegated to prehistory. This paper documents how the systematic counting of publications originated with psychologists. In the early 1900s, psychologists began collecting statistics on their discipline. Publications came to be counted in addresses, reviews and histories of psychology for several decades. The aim was to contribute to the advancement of psychology. Far from being a negligible output of a prehistoric type, both the volume and the systematicness of these efforts are witnesses to what should be considered as pioneering work, and their authors considered as forerunners to bibliometrics.","N/A"

Applications of these three bibliometric types will be described within the framework of Weinberg's internal and external criteria, whether the work being done is good science, efficiently and effectively done, and whether it is important science from a technological viewpoint. Within all bibliometrics the fundamental assumption is that the frequency with which a set of papers or patents is cited is a measure of the impact or influence of the set of papers. The literature bibliometric indicators are counts of publications and citations received in the scientific literature and various derived indicators including such phenomena as cross-sectoral citation, coauthorship and concentration within influential journals. One basic observation of literature bibliometrics, which carries over to patent bibliometrics, is that of highly skewed distributions - with a relatively small number of high-impact patents and papers, and large numbers of patents and papers of minimal impact. The key measure is whether an agency is producing or supporting highly cited papers and patents. The final set of data are in the area of linkage bibliometrics, looking at citations from patents to scientific papers. These are particularly relevant to the external criteria, in that it is quire obvious that institutions and supporting agencies whose papers are highly cited in patents are making measurable contributions to a nation's technological progress.","N/A"

While bibliometrics is attractive because it rapidly provides numbers that bear a certain relation to scientific productivity, it is often misused. The parameters chosen are questionable and sometimes worthless because of material errors or inappropriate use.

However, no gold standard exists for a set of reliable and valid (field-normalized) impact indicators in research evaluation. This opinion paper recommends that bibliometricians develop and analyze these impact indicators against the backdrop of Popper's critical rationalism. The studies critically investigating the indicators should publish the results in such a way that they can be included in meta-analyses. The results of meta-analyses give guidance on which indicators can then be part of a set of indicators used as standard in bibliometrics.

Scientists are now deemed to be successful on the sole condition that their work be abundantly cited. This world-wide trend appears to enjoy support not only by granting agencies (whose task is obviously simplified by extensive recourse to bibliometrics), but also by the scientists themselves (who seem to enjoy their status of celebrities). This trend appears to be fraught with dangers, particularly in the area of social sciences, where bibliometrics are less developed, and where monographs (which are not taken into account in citation indexes) are often more important than articles published in journals. We argue in favour of a return to the values of 'real science', in analogy to the much-promised return to a 'real economy'. While economists may strive towards a more objective evaluation of the prospects of a company, a market, or an industrial sector, we scientists can only base our appraisal on a responsible practice of peer review. Since we fear that decision-takers of granting agencies such as the FNRS, CTI, EPFL, ETHZ, ANR, CNRS, NIH, NSF, DOE,([1]) etc. will be too busy to read our humble paper in Chimia, we appeal to scientists of all countries and disciplines to unite against the tyranny of bibliometrics.","Bibliometrics; Citation indices; Eigenfactors; h-Factors; Fun factors; Impact factors; Science policy; Teaching factors"

In this perspective, journal performance indicators can play an important role in journal evaluation. Opinions on the appropriate use of journal-level bibliometrics indicators can be divided but they have now long been used as measures in research evaluation, and many editors see it as part of their editorial duty to try and improve bibliometrics indicators and rankings for their journal. There are various techniques through which this can be attempted, some more ethical than others. Some editors may try to boost the bibliometrics performance of their journals through gratuitous citations. This is problematic because citations are meant to provide useful references, scientifically justifiable, to previously published literature. As such citations can be used as widely accepted measures of scientific impact. Therefore, superfluous citations can distort the validity of bibliometrics indicators. It might be tempting to try to improve a journal's bibliometrics rankings at all costs, but these are only as meaningful as the data that feed into them. Exceedingly inflated indicators due to unethical behaviours can damage the reputation of a journal and its editors, and can lead to a loss of quality manuscript submissions, which in turn is likely to affect the journal's future citation impact.

He has especially emphasized two strands. One is the concept of obsolescence and how it applies in practice. The other is citation studies of the social sciences, which tend to have been ignored in comparison with the sciences. He has particularly explored the limitations that need to be taken into account when trying to apply bibliometric ideas in practical contexts. Design/methodology/approach - An analysis of Line ' s publications on bibliometrics led to a selection of major themes in his writings. A subsequent study of the publications of others who wrote on this topic over the same period provided a framework for assessing his work. Findings - Maurice Line played an important role in the development of this area of bibliometrics, though he slightly modified some of his early ideas as time has passed.

It draws evidence from the data of two experiments of the Italian governmental agency for research evaluation. The experiments were performed by the agency for validating the adoption in the Italian research assessment exercises of a dual system of evaluation, where some outputs were evaluated by bibliometrics and others by peer review. The two experiments were based on stratified random samples of journal articles. Each article was scored by bibliometrics and by peer review. The degree of concordance between the two evaluations is then computed. The correct setting of the experiments is defined by developing the design-based estimation of the Cohen's kappa coefficient and some testing procedures for assessing the homogeneity of missing proportions between strata. The results of both experiments show that for each research areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics the degree of agreement between bibliometrics and peer review is-at most-weak at an individual article level. Thus, the outcome of the experiments does not validate the use of the dual system of evaluation in the Italian research assessments. More in general, the very weak concordance indicates that metrics should not replace peer review at the level of individual article. Hence, the use of the dual system in a research assessment might worsen the quality of information compared to the adoption of peer review only or bibliometrics only.","N/A"

In this paper, we outline such a framework: the fast-and-frugal heuristics research program, proposed originally in the context of the cognitive and decision sciences, lends itself particularly well for understanding and investigating the usage of bibliometrics in research evaluations. Such evaluations represent judgments under uncertainty in which typically not all possible options, their consequences, and those consequences' probabilities of occurring may be known. In these situations of incomplete information, candidate descriptive and prescriptive models of human behavior are heuristics. Heuristics are simple strategies that, by exploiting the structure of environments, can aid people to make smart decisions. Relying on heuristics does not mean trading off accuracy against effort: while reducing complexity, heuristics can yield better decisions than more information-greedy procedures in many decision environments. The prescriptive power of heuristics is documented in a cross-disciplinary literature, cutting across medicine, crime, business, sports, and other domains. We outline the fast-and-frugal heuristics research program, provide examples of past empirical work on heuristics outside the field of bibliometrics, explain why heuristics may be especially suitable for studying the usage of bibliometrics, and propose a corresponding conceptual framework.","Bibliometrics; Fast-and-frugal heuristics; Research evaluation"

Here, we argue that bibliometrics have the potential to widen scientific participation by allowing non-academic stakeholders to access scientific decision making, thereby increasing the democratisation of science. Government policies from 3 countries (UK, Australia and Spain) are reviewed. Each country outlines a commitment to the democratisation of science for one set of policies whilst ignoring this commitment when developing parallel research evaluation policies. We propose a change in dialogue from whether bibliometrics should be used to how they should be used in future evaluations. Future research policies should take advantage of bibliometrics to foster greater democratisation of research to create more socially-reflexive evaluation systems.","democratisation of science; research evaluation; science and innovation policy; public engagement"

This overall inductive combined method, which we name BIBGT (BIB = Bibliometrics; GT = Grounded Theory) provides a powerful instrument for researchers. This instrument has been made more readily accessible by recent technological developments, and scientific advances in the field of bibliometrics. Notably, BIBGT helps grounded theorists identify colleges of thought of the field being reviewed, and representative texts to be reviewed in depth, in each college; it improves the trustworthiness and efficiency of reviews. BIBGT helps bibliometricians achieve in-depth analysis and interpretation of their findings. For all researchers, BIBGT can nurture the emergence of novel insights towards in-depth description, understanding or explanation of a core concept, theme, or research domain. We detail the four steps of this flexible method, providing essential elements and some guidelines as well as an illustration, to help other researchers who wish to apply it.","Bibliometrics; grounded theory; literature review; scientific information overload; systematicity; transparency"

The numerous dos and don'ts that exist in the field represent the implicit knowledge of experienced users, rather than a clearly defined set of rules and operating procedures. Our chapter seeks to establish standards for applying bibliometrics to the evaluation of research institutes in a number of areas in the natural sciences. These standards refer to the selection of the underlying data from the reference databases, the statistical analysis of the data and the presentation of results. We draw upon anonymized data from six research institutes active in similar research areas to illustrate the applicability of our proposed standards.","Bibliometrics; Standards; Publication Output; Citations"

Methods: Historical, descriptive, and exploratory bibliometrics analyses were used. The papers were harvested from the Scopus bibliographical database (Elsevier, Maribor, Netherlands), on November 18th, 2018, using the search string bibliometric* in publication titles, abstracts, and keywords, limited to the subject of nursing, for the period 1970 to 2018. Findings: The search resulted in 531 publications with 18 publications removed after manual inspection of publications abstracts. The literature production trend was positive. The nursing specific historical roots appeared only recently. The United States of America and Spain were the most productive countries, and most papers were published in Nutricion Hospitalaria and the Journal of Advanced Nursing. Descriptive analysis, research evaluation, content analysis, citation analyses, and trend analysis in nursing research were the most prolific themes. Conclusions: Applications of bibliometric in nursing is comparable to bibliometrics use in general, however there are some gaps including the use of altmetrics and of Big Data analysis.","Bibliometrics; Nursing research; Papers as topics; Historical roots; Thematic analysis"

This paper provides our overview regarding this area. We first reviewed the spatial information mining derived from literature, including structured and unstructured data. The spatial display and the basic spatial operations for the geographic information derived from literature were then introduced, demonstrating that GIS can be directly used to construct digital libraries. Some literature database websites have begun to utilize WEBGIS to display the spatial distribution of an author's location. Additionally, the spatial distribution information can be displayed in various modes with other specialized tools. Potential spatial analyses in bibliometrics were then discussed, introducing geostatistical and buffer analyses as case studies. Finally, several bibliometric indicators attached with research units were investigated. When the quantitative research index units are linked with the research spatial position, they can be displayed, queried and retrieved spatially. Future work to advance the application and research of GIS in bibliometrics is still warranted.","Bibliometrics; Geographic information system (GIS); Spatial visualization; Spatial analysis"

Librarians are responding with service innovations in areas such as bibliometrics and research data management. Previous surveys have investigated research data support within North America and other research services globally with small samples. An online multiple-choice questionnaire was used to survey bibliometric and data support activities of 140 libraries in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, including current and planned services, target audiences, service constraints, and staff training needs. A majority of respondents offered or planned bibliometrics training, citation reports, and impact calculations but with significant differences between countries. Current levels of engagement in data management were lower than for bibliometrics, but a majority anticipated future involvement, especially in technology assistance, data deposit, and policy development. Initiatives were aimed at multiple constituencies, with university administrators being important clients and partners for bibliometric services. Gaps in knowledge, skills, and confidence were significant constraints, with near-universal support for including bibliometrics and particularly data management in professional education and continuing development programs. The study also found that librarians need a multilayered understanding of the research environment.","N/A"

Furthermore, new tools now mean that it is both possible and relevant for bibliometrics novices to use bibliometrics to support literature reviews. Applying the BIBGT method and combining two bibliometric techniques - co-citation analysis of references and bibliographic coupling of documents - can enhance the efficiency of the first three types of literature review. This paper provides examples of published works that apply BIBGT to each of these types of review and highlights the bibliometric software used. It concludes with a survey of promising applications for all researchers and makes recommendations for both experienced literature review researchers and literature review novices.","Theoretical positioning; types of literature review; bibliometrics; BIBGT; co-citation analysis of references; bibliographic coupling of documents"

Rather than thinking of reflexivity as something fixed, it may be more productive to think of reflexivity as a process of becoming. Based on a conceptual framework inspired by Deleuze, the following contribution addresses notions of reflexivity between sociology and bibliometrics from a perspective of reflexive bibliometrics by a partial reconstruction, or, more precisely, a reconstructive rereading of the history of citation theory. I argue that following the procedural heuristic I will propose may be productive by neither framing reflexivity as an issue of static being of a discipline by asking ""How reflexive are we?"", nor an imperative of ""We should be more reflexive!"" but rather by asking ""How and why do we want to become more reflexive by seeking connections to different perspectives?"". Finally, I will discuss the potential of irony as a distancing function complementary to objectivity when applying the framework to your own discipline.","Reflexivity; bibliometrics; Deleuze; citation theory; becomings; sociology"

In the UK, for example, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) has employed bibliometric analysis alongside wider information in several awarding panels for major funding schemes. In this paper, we examine various aspects of the use of bibliometric information by members of these award selection panels, based on interviews with ten panel members from three NIHR panels, alongside analysis of the information provided to those panels. The aim of the work is to determine what influence bibliometrics has on their decision-making, to see which types of bibliometric measures they find more and less useful, and to identify the challenges they have when using these data. We find that panel members broadly support the use of bibliometrics in panel decision-making, and that the data are primarily used in the initial individual assessment of candidates, playing a smaller role in the selection panel meeting. Panel members felt that the most useful measures of performance are normalised citation scores and the number or proportion of papers in the most highly cited X% (e.g. 5, 10%) for the field. Panel members expressed concerns around the comparability of bibliometrics between fields, but the discussion suggested this largely represents a lack of understanding of bibliometric techniques, confirming that effective background information is important.

Traditional bibliometrics have long been utilized to measure a study's academic impact, but they fail to capture the impact generated through social media sharing. Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) is a weighted count of all the online attention garnered by a study, and it is currently unclear whether a relationship with traditional bibliometrics exists.Methods We identified the five highest-rated spine-specific and five highest-rated general orthopedic journals by Scopus CiteScore 2020. We then identified all the spine trauma studies across a 5-year span (2016-2020) within these journals and compared AAS with traditional bibliometrics using Independent t-tests and Pearson's correlational analyses.Results No statistically significant relationships were identified between AAS and traditional bibliometrics for articles pertaining to spine trauma: Level of Evidence (R = - 0.02, p = 0.34), H-Index Primary Author (R = < - 0.01, p = 0.50), H-Index Senior Author (R = - 0.04, p = 0.24), and Number of Citations (R = 0.01, p = 0.40). The top five articles by AAS include those pertaining to motorcycle injuries (AAS = 687), orthosis in thoracolumbar fractures (AAS = 199), golfing injuries (AAS = 166), smartphone-based teleradiology (AAS = 41), and auto racing injuries (AAS = 39).Conclusion The lack of overlap between these types of metrics suggests that AAS or similar alternative metrics should be used to measure an article's social impact. The social impact of an article should likewise be a factor in determining an article's overall impact along with its academic impact as measured by bibliometrics.","Altmetrics; Spine trauma; Bibliometrics; Social media"

Bibliometrics-based heuristics (BBHs) are simple decision strategies for evaluative purposes based on bibliometric indicators. One aim of the heuristics research program is to develop methods for studying the use of BBHs in research evaluation. Many deans probably evaluate rough performance differences between researchers in their departments based on h index values. Bornmann, Ganser, Tekles, and Leydesdorff (2020) developed the Stata command h_index and R package hindex which can be deployed in a fast and frugal way to decide on the following question: can the h index be used to compare all researchers in a university department, or are the citation cultures so different between sub-groups in the department that not all researchers can be compared with one another? The command and package can be used for simulations that might answer the question before extensive processes of data collection start. If the citation cultures are very different in the sub-groups, the researchers should be compared with field-normalized indicators (instead of the h index). This paper shows how the h_index command and hindex package can be employed for the decision on the h index use in the BBH.","Bibliometrics; Bibliometrics-based heuristics; Bibliometrics-based decision trees; h index"

Bibliometrics are an essential aspect of measuring academic and organizational performance. Aim. This review seeks to describe methods for measuring bibliometrics, identify the strengths and limitations of methodologies, outline strategies for interpretation, summarise evaluation of nursing and midwifery performance, identify implications for metric of evaluation, and specify the implications for nursing and midwifery and implications of social networking for bibliometrics and measures of individual performance. Method. A review of electronic databases CINAHL, Medline, and Scopus was undertaken using search terms such as bibliometrics, nursing, and midwifery. The reference lists of retrieved articles and Internet sources and social media platforms were also examined. Results. A number of well-established, formal ways of assessment have been identified, including h-and c-indices. Changes in publication practices and the use of the Internet have challenged traditional metrics of influence. Moreover, measuring impact beyond citation metrics is an increasing focus, with social media representing newer ways of establishing performance and impact. Conclusions. Even though a number of measures exist, no single bibliometric measure is perfect. Therefore, multiple approaches to evaluation are recommended. However, bibliometric approaches should not be the only measures upon which academic and scholarly performance are evaluated.","N/A"

Today, the simple counting of publications has been supplemented with a whole range of bibliometric indicators, which supposedly not only measures the volume of research but also its impact. In this study, we investigate how bibliometrics are used for evaluating the impact and quality of publications in two specific settings: biomedicine and economics. Our study exposes the various metrics used in external evaluations of candidates for academic positions at Swedish universities. Moreover, we show how different bibliometric indicators, both explicitly and implicitly, are employed to assess and rank candidates. Our findings contribute to a further understanding of bibliometric indicators as 'judgment devices' that are employed in evaluating individuals and their published works within specific fields. We also show how 'expertise' in using bibliometrics for evaluative purposes is negotiated at the interface between domain knowledge and skills in using indicators. In line with these results, we propose that the use of metrics we report is best described as a form of 'citizen bibliometrics'- an underspecified term which we build upon in the article.","citizen bibliometrics; economics; biomedicine; judgment devices; Journal Impact Factor; h-index"

Results are reported from a survey among libraries in Sweden with organized bibliometric activities. Incorporating bibliometric activities is one way of redefining and widening the role of the library. Implementation of bibliometric practice is motivated by ambitions to provide more complete scholarly communication-related services, as well as to increase the visibility and status of libraries. Underlying reasons are professional competencies such as metadata and bibliographic database management; and bibliometrics being strong within library and information science. Incorporating bibliometrics in academic libraries is also seen as a way of widening the professional profile of librarianship. The new role should, however, also be considered from the viewpoint of potential changes in how academic libraries are perceived when incorporating a monitoring function through bibliometric analyses of research performance in addition to traditional service-oriented functions.","Academic libraries; bibliometrics; profession; research evaluation; role of libraries; librarianship"

In contrast, when the fruits of their research are being evaluated, basic scientific standards do not seem to matter. Instead, simplistic bibliometric indicators (i.e., publication and citation counts) are, paradoxically, both widely used and criticized without any methodological and theoretical framework that would serve to ground both use and critique. Recently, however Bornmann and Marewski (2019) proposed such a framework. They developed bibliometrics-based heuristics (BBHs) based on the fast-and-frugal heuristics approach (Gigerenzer; Todd; ABC Research Group, 1999) to decision making, in order to conceptually understand and empirically investigate the quantitative evaluation of research as well as to effectively train end-users of bibliometrics (e.g., science managers, scientists). Heuristics are decision strategies that use part of the available information and ignore the rest. By exploiting the statistical structure of task environments, they can aid to make accurate, fast, effortless, and cost-efficient decisions without that trade-offs are incurred. Because of their simplicity, heuristics are easy to understand and communicate, enhancing the transparency of decision processes. In this commentary, we explain several BBHs and discuss how such heuristics can be employed in practice (using the evaluation of applicants for funding programs as one example). Furthermore, we outline why heuristics can perform well, and how they and their fit to task environments can be studied. In pointing to the potential of research on BBHs and to the risks that come with an under-researched, mindless usage of bibliometrics, this commentary contributes to make research evaluation more scientific.","Bibliometrics; Heuristics; Bibliometrics-based heuristics; Research evaluation; Decision strategies"

Research e-visibility as concept encapsulates knowledge sharing in academia by empowering researchers to embrace online research communities and platforms with online sharing and dissemination of research publications. The presence of a research e-profile on a research community becomes the vehicle for e-visibility by creating a research presence for the researcher, allowing the researcher to become more discoverable and enhancing the accessibility of the researcher's research output (share knowledge). This paper reports on the influence of altmetrics derived from Academia.edu, an academic social networking tool as example of an online research community, on the bibliometrics of the corresponding researchers' citations on Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar. The investigation of the e-visibility themes: research online presence, researcher discoverability and research accessibility allows for the using of the altmetrics from Academia.edu and the bibliometrics from the citation resources, to establish the altmetric-bibliometric relationships and the contribution of altmetrics and bibliometrics to evisibility. The altmetric and bibliometric data sourced from data sets (which was collected at 6-month intervals from December 2014 to December 2016), as part of a longitudinal comparative e-visibility study for participating Environmental Sciences researchers at the University of South Africa (Unisa). The altmetrics and bibliometrics data were analysed and the Spearman correlation rank coefficients calculated using SPSS software. The results indicate that there are positive correlations between the Academia.edu altmetrics and the Environmental Science researchers' bibliometrics. These correlations show that Acadmeia.edu altmetrics have a positive societal influence on the citations of the Environmental Sciences researchers. These findings recommend that environmental science researchers create and maintain a research eprofile on Academia.edu with the aim of increasing their e-visibility and enhancing knowledge sharing amongst researchers in academia. The significant contribution of the paper is to give perspective on the relationships between the altmetrics and bibliometrics for the Environmental Science researchers in South Africa.","E-visibility; Academia.edu; altmetrics; bibliometrics; altmetric-bibliometric relationships"

The first attempts at systematic data collection were provided by Alfred Lotka and Samuel Bradford, who subsequently established the foundational laws of bibliometrics. Eugene Garfield ushered in the modern era of bibliometrics with the routine use of citation analysis and systematized processing. Key elements of bibliometric analysis include database coverage, consistency and accuracy of the data, data fields, search options, and analysis and use of metrics. A number of bibliometric applications are currently being used in medical science and health care. Bibliometric parameters and indexes may be increasingly used by grant funding sources as measures of research success. Universities may build benchmarking standards from bibliometric data to determine academic achievement through promotion and tenure guidelines in the future. This article reviews the history, definition, laws, and elements of bibliometric principles and provides examples of bibliometric applications to the broader health care community. To accomplish this, the Medline (1966-2014) and Web of Science (1945-2014) databases were searched to identify relevant articles; select articles were also cross-referenced. Articles selected were those that provided background, history, descriptive analysis, and application of bibliometric principles and metrics to medical science and health care. No attempt was made to cover all areas exhaustively; rather, key articles were chosen that illustrate bibliometric concepts and enhance the reader's knowledge. It is important that faculty and researchers understand the limitations and appropriate uses of bibliometric data. Bibliometrics has considerable potential as a research area for health care scientists and practitioners that can be used to discover new information about academic trends, pharmacotherapy, disease, and broader health sciences trends.","bibliometrics; history; laws; application; pharmacy; medicine; publications"

Bibliometrics is a set of methods used to study or measure texts and information. While bibliometric methods are most often used in the field of library and information science, bibliometrics variables have wide applications in other areas. One popular bibliometric variable is Garfield's Impact Factor (IF). IF is used to explore the impact of a given field, the impact of a set of researchers, or the impact of a particular paper. This variable is used to assess academic output and it is believed to affect adversely the traditional approach and assessment of scientific research. In our country, the members of the evaluation committees of intensive research institutions, e.g. the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) use IF to assess the quality of research. This article revises the exponential growth of bibliometrics and attempts to expose the overall dissatisfaction with the analytical quality of IF. Such dissatisfaction is expressed in the number of investigations attempting to obtain a better variable of improved analytical quality.","bibliometrics; impact factor; scientometrics"

We compare the accuracy of the first national evaluation exercise, conducted entirely by peer-review, to other rankings lists prepared at zero cost, based on indicators indirectly linked to performance or available on the Internet. The results show that, for the hard sciences, the costs of conducting the Italian evaluation of research institutions could have been completely avoided.","Research evaluation; Bibliometrics; VTR; Ranking; Productivity; Universities"

Representations and uses of bibliometric indicators in the Italian daily newspapers","2022","SCIENTOMETRICS","10.1007/s11192-022-04341-6","Scholars in science and technology studies and bibliometricians are increasingly revealing the performative nature of bibliometric indicators. Far from being neutral technical measures, indicators such as the Impact Factor and the h-index are deeply transforming the social and epistemic structures of contemporary science. At the same time, scholars have highlighted how bibliometric indicators are endowed with social meanings that go beyond their purely technical definitions. These social representations of bibliometric indicators are constructed and negotiated between different groups of actors within several arenas. This study aims to investigate how bibliometric indicators are used in a context, which, so far, has not yet been covered by researchers, that of daily newspapers. By a content analysis of a corpus of 583 articles that appeared in four major Italian newspapers between 1990 and 2020, we chronicle the main functions that bibliometrics and bibliometric indicators played in the Italian press. Our material shows, among other things, that the public discourse developed in newspapers creates a favorable environment for bibliometrics-centered science policies, that bibliometric indicators contribute to the social construction of scientific facts in the press, especially in science news related to medicine, and that professional bibliometric expertise struggles to be represented in newspapers and hence reach the general public.","Social uses of bibliometrics; Social construction of bibliometric indicators; Performance-based research evaluation; Italy; Impact Factor; h-index"

This conception presents a specification within the sociology of knowledge: the Theory of the Scientific Field. Given its adaptability to various fields, domains and scientific disciplines; this theory can be applied to any area of knowledge. Although the effectiveness of bibliometrics has been widely demonstrated in the study of topics, disciplines and domains of knowledge, it is evident that it has been little used to describe scientific fields. The present study is focused on establishing the links between sociology of knowledge, Field Theory and bibliometrics to describe scientific fields. The research classified as descriptive with theoretical contribution. The results were obtained mainly through methods in the theoretical planes. At the empirical level, the documentary analysis was decisive, using Peirre Bourdieu (1976) as the main author. The study identified the characteristics of the Scientific Field Theory and bibliometrics. The above will identify the interception nodes between both conceptions, allowing to visualize their scope in the delimitation and characterization of the structure of particular fields. It was concluded that the analysis of scientific fields requires to processing of large volumes of information. Bibliometry as a bibliometric method and discipline can favor the delimitation of a scientific field from the objective relationships (publications) between the agents of the field. The main variables that allow describing scientific fields are those related to production, collaboration and impact.","Pierre Bourdieu; Theory of fields; Sociology of knowledge; Bibliometrics; Scientific fields"

In this context, the objective of this article was to elaborate and apply a model of analysis of eponyms present in scientific articles in the field of Bibliometrics. This is an exploratory and descriptive research with a qualitative-quantitative methodology and anchored in bibliometric and content analyses. The corpus of analysis consisted of eponyms (n=246) selected from articles (n=104) published in five journals in the field of Information Science. The main results indicated that the most frequent eponyms were the three classical laws of Bibliometrics (Bradford's Law, Lotka's Law and Zipf's Law), followed by eponymous expressions from other areas of knowledge, such as Mathematics and Statistics, as well as the occurrence of obliteration by incorporation arising from the non-citation of the original works that originated the eponyms. Among the eponymists (n=203) one stood out for citing the majority (n=21) of the eponymized (n=38). Thus, by choosing a theoretical framework based on the Sociology of Science and Information Science, the analysis model developed and applied to a set of scientific texts shed light on the understanding of the reward system of science through the study of eponymy in the field of Bibliometrics.","eponyms; scientific recognition; sociology of science; information science; bibliometrics"

These metrics provide important insights into the quality and impact of research by applying standardised metrics. However, there are inherent limitations in their application. Objective: We aimed to review existing bibliometric indices and assess their comparative utility in the assessment of medical researchers. We specifically aimed to evaluate the utility of the h-index in identifying young or developing medical researchers with future research potential. Method: We conducted a focussed literature review on commonly used bibliometrics. To explore the utility of these metrics we then used them to evaluate a sample of researchers from a South African medical school faculty. Researchers were ranked with the following metrics: number of publications; h-index; citations per paper; citations per paper per year; and m-index. The h-index, citations and publication counts were drawn from ResearchGate and, if not available, from Google Scholar. The top 20 researchers, based on publication count, were then analysed further. Results: We identified 145 researchers for analysis of which 37 were excluded due to an inability to obtain additional information. Higher time-dependent metrics (publication count, citation count, h-index) were directly proportional to years since first publication. Indices that corrected for time, such as the m-index, provided more insight and better discrimination in identifying younger researchers with greater research potential. Conclusion: Bibliometrics have utility as part of the assessment of academic output but may be subject to time-dependent bias. Research quality is best measured using the h-index, g-index and m-index. The h-index is limited by being time dependent and field specific and overlooks highly cited papers. Bibliometrics that account for time, such as the m-index, should be considered in the early identification of young researchers, ideally accompanied by critical peer review.","bibliometrics; clinical research; h-index; m-index"

Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) is a quantitative measurement of online influence of research in real time. The objective of this study is to determine if AAS correlates with traditional bibliometrics in the orthopaedic literature. Materials and Methods: From the 15 orthopaedic journals with the highest impact factor, the 10 most cited articles from each journal were reviewed for 2014 -2017. For each article, AAS was collected using the Altmetric Bookmarklet application and citation count from SCOPUS. Journal impact factor was recorded using Journal Citation Reports. Statistical analysis included Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients. Results: A total of 600 articles were analyzed. A significant positive correlation was found between citation count and AAS for 2014 (r = 0.3188, p < 0.0001), and no correlation for 2015 (r = 0.1504, P = 0.0653), 2016 (r = 0.0087, P = 0.9157), and 2017 (r = 0.0061, P = 0.9408). There was no significant correlation between impact factor and AAS in 2014 (r = 0.4312, P = 0.1085), 2015 (r = 0.3850, P = 0.1565), 2016 (r = 0.1460, P = 0.6035) and 2017 (r = 0.0451 P = 0.8732). Conclusions: AAS and traditional bibliometrics are currently not strongly correlated in orthopaedic literature. Citations take years to accumulate and AAS represents immediate influence of an article. An amalgamation of traditional bibliometrics and AAS may prove useful in determining the short- and long-term impact and influence of publications in orthopaedics.

This study presents a multivariate analysis of gastroenterology and hepatology journals to evaluate the predictive ability of seven bibliometrics in the Web of Science to calculate total cites over a 2-year period. Methods Coincidentally, bibliometrics appearing during 2008, 2009, and 2010, with their corresponding cites in 2010, 2011, and 2012, were recorded from the Journal Citation Reports Science Edition. A linear mixed-effects design using random slopes and intercepts was performed on 51 out of 74 journals in the Gastroenterology and Hepatology category. Result There was a significant global effect size (R-2 = 0.992; P < 0.001), which yielded a total variance of 99.2%. The strongest predictors in the model were the Eigenfactor Score and Cited Half-life (P < 0.001), followed by the Number of Articles (P = 0.011) and the Immediacy Index (P = 0.021). The impact factor was not a significant predictor. Conclusion The Eigenfactor Score and Cited Half-life predictors might be the new standards to assess the influence and importance of scientific journals; this approach may help researchers select journals in which to publish their work.

Very weak correlations were found between AASs and citations [0.124 (95% CI, 0.108-0.14)], AASs and RCRs [0.26 (95% CI, 0.244-0.275)], and AASs and CNCIs [0.207 (95% CI, 0.192-0.223)]. The weak correlations were also found between AASs and impact factors in several journals. The weak correlations between AASs and citations, AASs and CNCIs, and AASs and RCRs were also found for most journals based on subgroup analysis. Conclusions. There is very weak correlations between AASs and traditional bibliometrics in top nursing journal articles. More studies should be conducted to assess how AAS influence bibliometrics, and how they can help manage nursing journal articles and research.","N/A"

We highlight the importance of 'uncertainty' within information fusion and argue that this concept is crucial also for bibliometrics and information retrieval. More specifically, we elaborate on three research strategies related to uncertainty: uncertainty management methods, explanation of uncertainty and visualization of uncertainty. We exemplify our strategies to the classical problem of author name disambiguation where we show how uncertainty can be modeled explained and visualized using information fusion. We show how an information seeker can benefit from tracing increases/decreases of uncertainty in the reasoning process. We also present how such changes can be explained for the information seeker through visualization techniques, which are employed to highlight the complexity involved in the process of modeling and managing uncertainty in bibliometric analysis. Finally we argue that a further integration of information fusion approaches in the research area of bibliometrics and information retrieval may results in new and fruitful venues of research.","Uncertainty; Information fusion; Information retrieval; Bibliometrics; Author name disambiguation; Bibliographic data"

Bibliometrics constitute a set of mathematical and statistical techniques employed to explore, organize, and quantitatively analyze large pools of scientific literature. In this study, 11,433 papers published between 1974 and 2015 are collected and analyzed by applying life-cycle analysis, bibliometrics and text mining in order to provide a full thematic overview of the application of fuzzy theory in operations management. Top countries (i.e. the most productive, influential and collaborative countries), most frequently cited journals, and key research topics are identified by employing bibliometric techniques. Finally, the articles' common research themes and methodologies are determined by combining text mining with experts' input. Results show that the application of fuzzy theory in operations management is still in its infancy, and hence suitable for future research. This study serves as a guide for researchers to identify the hidden patterns, key actors, topics, and methods in this area.","Fuzzy sets theory; Operations management; Bibliometrics; Text mining; Life-cycle analysis"

It targets clinicians and researchers (academic and non-academic) in our discipline who would like to use bibliometric indicators as a complementary ""tool"" to integrate into their expert practice of journal evaluation. Different journal-based metrics are analysed in order to provide a wide (albeit general) view of the performance of top PRM journals. First, we provide some brief preliminary remarks useful for an informed understanding of our results: 1) an update on bibliometric indicators and multidisciplinary databases of peer-reviewed literature; 2) the meaning of some bibliometric indicators; 3) the practical message related to this report: ""keep it simple."" Then, we profile the performance of 22 PRM core journals, according to six widely used bibliometric indicators. Indicators are grouped into three categories defined by their quartile classification (Three Star: top quartile; Two Star: second upper quartile; One Star: under the median). In conclusion, bibliometrics is just one of the key methods used for measuring the (supposed) 'impact' of scholarly publications and it represents only a raw proxy for the real impact or value of the research. This report wishes to add a small contribution for a simplified understanding of journal-level indicators in PRM, to support informed decisions on which high-level journals merit special attention by clinicians and researchers working in our discipline.","Physical and rehabilitation medicine; Bibliometrics; Publishing; Journal Impact Factors"

This revaluation is conducted under a frame-work somehow neglected by the historiography of science and the historiography of bibliometrics, in particular. Contrasting with much of the literature that references ""heroic"" works as episodic, unconnected and isolated efforts, this paper examines the ""heroic"" literature in the context of the debate among historians between those supporting the idea of an history of the unique (historic evenementielle) and those supporting a serial history. From this particular point of view, this paper deals with the ""heroic age"" of bibliometrics and presented it as a continuous and systematic effort for developing a serial history of science whose major concern was to provide some sort of social explanation for science' development and growth. Its major achievement was, however, methodological in as much as the heroic age might be characterised as a quest for an standard data source for making the history of science.","history of bibliometrics; serial history of science; journalization of literature; standardisation of data sources"

This paper introduces the forecasting of biosensors that have the potential to be used in POC and IoT applications. For this research three types of biosensors were selected. These are hiosensors for testing of blood, saliva, and breath. Bibliometrics and patent analysis of these biosensors are used to develop technology maturity rates based on the Fisher-Pry model. The Science Citation Index (SCI) is used for bibliometrics and patent analysis is derived from global patent databases. The Fisher-Pry projections or Scarves enable insights into the maturity levels of the emerging hiosensor technologies under consideration and forecasting their growth. Patent analysis based on cumulative annual patent count indicated that blood hiosensors reached their technology maturity midpoint in 2009 with the midpoints of saliva and breath biosensors lagging by 8 and 14 years respectively. Bibliometrics with annual publication count did not appear to provide much value in forecasting the maturity growth of the three hiosensors.","N/A"

Eligible publications of all academic faculty members were verified from each researcher's curriculum vitae and Web of Science (R) (Thomson Reuters). For 3792 researchers, we identified 26,845 unique papers with 79,502 authors published from 2008 to 2012. The overall mean citations per paper for the faculty was 17.35. The academic departments with the highest levels of collaboration and interdisciplinary research activity also had the highest research impact. The citation window for biomedical scientific papers was still active at 5 years after publication, indicating that the citation window for publications in biomedical research is active longer than previously thought, and this may hinder the reliable use of bibliometrics when evaluating recent scientific publications in biomedical research.","Benchmarking; Research impact; Research productivity; Biomedical research; Citation window"

Therefore, Technology Intelligence is a crucial topic, which is characterized from the perspective of strategic information management as identifying, analyzing, and evaluating innovations of technologies. One of the methods that support Technology Intelligence is Bibliometrics, which is devoted to the quantitative analysis of literature by statistical means. Bibliometric research is most often used in the field of library science; 'it has also wide applications-in other areas. In this paper, a Bibliometrics-based methodology is proposed, which aims at improving the acquisition processes in the context of Technology Intelligence. Following the methodology, all the necessary information is firstly collected and filtered through information retrieval. Secondly and most importantly, bibliometric analysis is used to summarize the retrieved information and to figure out the possible technology indicators,.which characterize the development of technologies and their potential benefits. After expert consultations, the final technology indicators are identified and assigned with indicator values. The methodology is concretely explained via a case study. The methodology is embedded in the Technology Management System, which was developed by the Heinz Nixdorf Institute.

Methods: The sampled data included North Carolina Translational and Clinical Science Institute (NC TraCS)-supported publications produced between September 2008 and March 2021. We applied measures and metrics from bibliometrics, SNA, and altmetrics to the dataset. In addition, we analyzed research topics and correlations between different metrics. Results: 1154 NC TraCS-supported publications generated over 53,560 citation counts by April 2021. The average cites per year and the relative citation ratio (RCR) mean of these publications improved from 33 and 2.26 in 2017 to 48 and 2.58 in 2021. The number of involved UNC units in the most published authors' collaboration network increased from 7 (2017) to 10 (2021). NC TraCS-supported co-authorship involved 61 NC organizations. PlumX metrics identified articles with the highest altmetrics scores. About 96% NC TraCS-supported publications have above the average SciVal Topic Prominence Percentile; the average approximate potential to translate of the included publication was 54.2%; and 177 publications addressed health disparity issues. Bibliometric measures (e.g., citation counts, RCR) and PlumX metrics (i.e., Citations, Captures, and Social-Media) are positively correlated (p < .05). Conclusion: Bibliometrics, SNA, and altmetrics offer distinctive but related perspectives to examine CTSA research performance and longitudinal growth, especially at the individual program hub level. These perspectives can help CTSAs build program foci.","CTSA evaluation; translational research; bibliometrics; social network analysis; altmetrics"

A qualitative design was done using bibliometrics as library books were used to obtain the data. Results revealed from six hundred eight (608) collected rice-based kakanin recipes from eighty-nine (89) books that kakanin varies depending on its location and changes over time. Moreover, these varieties of kakanin can be grouped into fifteen (15) major clusters according to the kakanin's name, appearance, ingredients, process, and characteristics. Findings further revealed that some of this kakanin hold sentimental value to the area and locals who make it. Subsequently, the researchers constructed five (5) significance of kakanin: historical, aesthetics, culinary, social, and symbolical. Lastly, to widen the understanding of Filipino rice-based kakanin, this study encourages future research to have fieldwork on finding the traditional ingredients used in making kakanin and transmit to the next generation the traditional kakanin ways.","Bibliometrics; Culinary; Heritage; Kakanin; Significance"

"Kazakis N.A.","Bibliometric evaluation of the research performance of the Greek civil engineering departments in National and European context","2014","SCIENTOMETRICS","10.1007/s11192-014-1326-3","Quality evaluation and its assurance in higher education institutions constitute an obligation and scope of most European Universities. To accomplish this, quantitative indices, known as bibliometrics, are recruited which are considered a useful evaluation tool particularly for academics' and Universities' research performance. In the present study, the research quality of the five Greek civil engineering departments (Athens, Patras, Thessaloniki, Volos, Xanthi) is assessed by means of several advanced bibliometric indices calculated separately for each academic. Statistical analysis of the data is also performed to compare the observed differences in the mean values of the calculated indices. The study is conducted both in department and academic rank level to explore how research activity is distributed among the various ranks. In addition, to evaluate the research status of the Greek departments in the European context, their research output is compared with that of London civil engineering department. To explore the dependence of bibliometrics on seniority, bibliometric analysis considering the research activity of all academics only during the last decade is also made. Finally, the temporal progress of the research productivity leads to interesting findings about the impact of the European economic crisis on research performance. In general, bibliometrics demonstrate that Patras department host academics of better quality, but Athens exhibits higher scientific activity over the last decade. Superiority of London department is evident but few bibliometrics are comparable with the ones of the Greek departments. Results also indicate that no common standards in hiring/promotion of academics are established, while the European socio-economic crisis has significant negative impact on research productivity.","Research evaluation; Bibliometrics; h-index; Civil engineering; Seniority; Academic rank; Economic crisis"

Policy makers and industrial communities use roadmapping methods to predict future industrial growth, but the existing bibliometric/workshop methods have limitations when analyzing the full-lifecycle industrial emergence, including the transitions between science, technology, application, and the mass market. This paper, therefore, proposes a framework that integrates bibliometrics and a technology roadmapping (TRM) workshop approach to strategize and plan the future development of the new, technology-based industry. The dye-sensitized solar cell technology-based industry in China is selected as a case study. In this case, the bibliometrics method is applied to analyze the existing position of science and technology, and TRM workshops are used to strategize the future development from technology to application and marketing. Key events and impact on the development of the new, technology-based industry have been identified. This paper will contribute to the roadmapping and foresight methodology, and will be of interest to solar photovoltaic industry researchers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

As such, the paper reviews related work that has been of inspiration for the assembly of a semi-automatic, bibliometric-based, approach for construction and maintenance. Similarly, the paper discusses the methodical considerations behind the approach. Eventually, the semi-automatic approach is used to verify the applicability of bibliometric methods as a supplement to construction and maintenance of thesauri. In the context of knowledge organization, the paper outlines two fundamental approaches to knowledge organization, that is, the manual intellectual approach and the automatic algorithmic approach. Bibliometric methods belong to the automatic algorithmic approach, though bibliometrics do have special characteristics that are substantially different from other methods within this approach.","knowledge management; controlled language construction; cataloguing"

The goal is to highlight some weaknesses and clarify some ""dark sides"" in the conceptual framework of this analogy, discussing the formal validity and practical meaning of the concepts of Energy, Exergy and Entropy in bibliometrics. Specifically, this analogy highlights the following major criticalities: (1) the definitions of E and X are controversial, (2) the equivalence classes of E and X are questionable, (3) the parallel between the evolution of thermodynamic and bibliometric systems is forced, (4) X is a non-monotonic performance indicator, and (5) in bibliometrics the condition of ""thermodynamic perfection"" is questionable. Argument is supported by many analytical demonstrations and practical examples.","Bibliometrics; Thermodynamics; Exergy; Energy; Entropy; S = E - X; p-Index; Composite indicators"
